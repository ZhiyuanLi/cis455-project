are the amount and kind of the material used appropriate to the intended use? these questions are discussed, along with examples of applications, in the code of best practices in fair use for academic and research libraries. this is a very useful tool for making a fair use determination in typical teaching, learning, and research situations. codes of best practice in fair use have been developed for many other applications by scholars, artists, teachers, librarians, and other users and creators of content. examples include online video, opencourseware, and poetry. see the dartmouth library copyright information web pages for more details and assistance. copyright guidelines for the use of materials on course web sites and course reserves guidance to instructors, librarians, and support staff concerning the circumstances under which they may, consistent with the copyright law, place course materials on electronic reserves or on course web sites.        19 8019 801a 199  74 c contact us2f 24 top of page | 43copyright © 872016 trustees of dartmouth college 417f1d7ff 115 last updated: 4/9/150

overview of the new elephant community center asian elephants at the national zoo the smithsonian's national zoo is home to six elephants. elephant trails is one of the most popular exhibits at the zoo. the new expanded home fosters the development of a thriving, reproducing, multigenerational herd. visitors can see the elephants both indoors and out, giving them an opportunity to learn about the elephants in their rich and diverse zoo environment. elephant trails not only allows visitors to see and learn about asian elephants, it also gives scientists at the national zoo new opportunities to study elephants. elephant trails is the culmination of the zoo's enduring commitment to elephant care and research. its design is leed gold certified and incorporates environmentally friendly features. the innovative space includes a large barn, an elephant exercise trek through a forested area, three unique outdoor habitats, four water features and a large indoor elephant community center. the indoor communal space allows the elephants to interact and engage with stimulating features such as a giant sand pit, wading pool, and a shower they can operate themselves. video the history of elephants for 4,000 years, asian elephants have been an important part of life for people in asia. they've carried soldiers into battle, hauled logs, and taken part in religious ceremonies. but the number of asian elephants in the world is dwindling, and unless we act now they could soon go extinct. the international union for the conservation of nature's red list of threatened animals lists asian elephants as endangered. unfortunately, these pachyderms' populations have decreased by 70 percent due to human-elephant conflict and habitat loss. there are now only 30,000 to 50,000 animals living in 13 asian countries. very few areas in the wild can support elephant populations long-term, and without help the little remaining habitat asian elephants call home—along with many other species—may disappear within 20 years. in the wild, asian elephants help keep habitats diverse and full of life. they disperse fruits and their seeds, and create gaps in forest canopy that give small plants the sunlight they need to grow. without asian elephants, biodiversity in asian forests could significantly decrease and their ecosystems could lose supplies of food and water, as well as medicine-rich plants. about 15,000 asian elephants live in human care, including in zoos, timber camps, temples, and private camps, as well as other places. that is one-third of all the elephants in the world. as asian elephants' natural habitat disappears in the wild, the smithsonian's national zoo has built an innovative and stimulating new home for its own elephant herd that is the cornerstone of the zoo's campaign to save this magnificent species: elephant trails. newsroom events volunteers careers & internships contact about us privacy copyright help

for more than 40 years, the zoo has celebrated these charismatic bears by creating and maintaining one of the world's foremost panda conservation programs. in that time, the zoo's team - consisting of dozens of animal care staff, scientists, researchers, international collaborators and conservationists - has made great strides in saving this species from extinction by studying giant panda behavior, health, habitat, and reproduction. specifically, it has allowed scientists at the smithsonian's national zoo and conservation biology institute to learn about panda estrus, breeding, pregnancy, pseudopregnancy and cub development - work that is shared around the world with other institutions that also care for and breed this endangered species. breeding giant pandas scientists from the smithsonian conservation and biology institute's center for conservation and evolutionary genetics, have become adept at studying the genetic relatedness of pandas in human care. chinese colleagues maintain an up-to-date studbook of these endangered animals. our scientists developed the formula used to make breeding recommendations for the entire giant panda population in human care, ensuring that it is genetically healthy. scientists are working to preserve 90 percent of the genetic diversity of the giant panda population in human care. panda breeding season is a race against the biological clock. it only comes once a year and our giant panda team, including scientists from the smithsonian conservation and biology institute's center for species survival, and vets, keepers, and biologists from the animal care teams must be ready. giant panda females, like mei xiang, ovulate for just 24 to 72 hours. to identify the opening of that tiny window, animal keepers carefully watch mei xiang for any behavioral sign of estrus. at the same time, scientists monitor hormones in her urine to pinpoint the window when she is ready to breed. if attempts at natural breeding are not successful, scientists can step in, collect fresh or frozen-thawed semen from a male, and use the genetic material collected to artificially inseminate a female. at the zoo, three artificial inseminations have resulted in successful births: male tai shan in 2005, female bao bao in 2013, and a cub in 2015. saving pandas in the wild under the terms of the zoo's agreement with china, scientists at the smithsonian conservation and biology institute's conservation ecology center have studied these bears both in the wild and in human care. smithsonian conservation biology institute ecologists spend months in china every year studying wild pandas and their neighbors, such as asiatic black bears and takin. they teach colleagues in china how to conduct censuses and surveys of large mammals, including giant pandas that live in the wild, using geographic information systems (gis) and other high-tech tools for tracking wildlife. they are also working to identify new landscapes for giant panda reintroduction. field research has revealed that wild pandas' habitat is highly fragmented, which means pandas have a difficult time finding a mate. to address that problem, zoo scientists and colleagues have been exploring the possibility of creating "corridors" of forests that link isolated habitats. such corridors would give giant pandas more options for movement and mate selection. they might also assist with the reintroduction of captive-born pandas into the wild. the zoo's pandas are part of panda watch behavior study. each day, dedicated friends of the national zoo volunteers called panda watchers monitor the pandas' behavior via the panda cam. over the years, they've amassed mountains of data on the species, which is notoriously difficult to study in the wild. the future in december 2011, david m. rubenstein donated $4.5 million to the zoo to fund the giant panda program through 2016. in appreciation, the giant panda complex was named the david m. rubenstein family giant panda habitat. in addition, young conservation biologists in the u.s. and in china who were awarded smithsonian's national zoo fellowships for their work to save this endangered species were named "david m. rubenstein fellows." the gift was used to fund conservation efforts in china, reproductive science, professional training programs, giant panda care at the zoo, upgrades to the zoo habitats and public education. mr. rubenstein provided an additional $4.5 million donation in fall 2015. the gift allows the zoo's animal care and the smithsonian conservation biology institute's scientific team to proceed with the five-year science plan established with their chinese colleagues from the china wildlife conservation association. the science plan has specific goals: to examine the creation and impact of corridors to link fragmented habitats that will benefit giant pandas and other wildlife species, including promoting genetic diversity; examine how to restore habitats, especially those where pandas appear to be making a comeback; provide advice on giant panda reintroduction; examine the potential impact of transmissible diseases on giant pandas and other wildlife species, including providing advice on implementing new programs associated with a wildlife disease control center being built in sichuan province; and continue research on giant panda reproduction and management, because, although there has been major success in chinese breeding centers, some pandas still experience reproductive challenges. giant panda facts order: carnivora family: ursidae genus and species: ailuropoda melanoleuca geographic distribution: giant pandas live in a few mountain ranges in central china, in sichuan, shaanxi, and gansu provinces. they once lived in lowland areas, but farming, forest clearing, and other development now restrict giant pandas to the mountains. habitat: in the wild, giant pandas live in broadleaf and coniferous forests with a dense understory of bamboo, at elevations between 5,000 and 10,000 feet. torrential rains or dense mist throughout the year characterizes these forests, often shrouded in heavy clouds. the pandas' habitat in the zoo is designed to mimic the pandas' natural habitat of rocky, lush terrain in china. each element has a purpose - from helping the pandas stay cool in hot weather to giving them a place to hide when they need privacy. there are rock and tree structures perfect for climbing; grottoes, pools, and streams for keeping cool; and shrubs and trees, including weeping willows, corktrees, and maples, and several species of bamboo. the giant panda habitat has green design elements including a solar hot water system, columns made from bamboo (a rapidly renewable resource), and a green roof to reduce stormwater runoff. there are also visitor paths paved with natural tree-resin bound paving material and recycled rubber and benches made from ipe wood, which is naturally resistant to pests and rot. physical description: the giant panda, a black-and-white bear, has a body typical of bears. it has black fur on ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, and shoulders. the rest of the animal's coat is white. although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, some speculate that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage into their shade-dappled snowy and rocky surroundings. the panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. giant pandas have large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles for crushing tough bamboo. many people find these chunky, lumbering animals to be cute, but giant pandas can be as dangerous as any other bear. size: about the size of an american black bear, giant pandas stand between two and three feet tall at the shoulder (on all four legs), and reach four to six feet long. males are larger than females, weighing up to 250 pounds in the wild. females rarely reach 220 pounds. status: the giant panda is listed as endangered in the world conservation union's (iucn's) red list of threatened species. there are about 1,600 left in the wild. more than 300 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world, mostly in china. life span: scientists aren't sure how long giant pandas live in the wild, but they are sure it's shorter than lifespans in zoos. chinese scientists have reported zoo pandas as old as 35. the national zoo's hsing-hsing died at age 28 in 1999. diet: a wild giant panda's diet is almost exclusively (99 percent) bamboo. the balance consists of other grasses and occasional small rodents or musk deer fawns. in zoos, giant pandas eat bamboo, a special high-fiber biscuit, carrots, apples, and sweet potatoes. social structure: adult giant pandas are generally solitary, but they do communicate periodically through scent marks, calls, and occasional meetings. offspring stay with their mothers from one and a half to three years. the giant panda has lived in bamboo forests for several million years. it is a highly specialized animal, with unique adaptations. feeding adaptions: millions of zoo visitors enjoy watching giant pandas eat. a panda usually eats while sitting upright, in a pose that resembles how humans sit on the floor. this posture leaves the front paws free to grasp bamboo stems with the help of a "pseudo thumb," formed by an elongated and enlarged wrist bone covered with a fleshy pad of skin. the panda also uses its powerful jaws and strong teeth to crush the tough, fibrous bamboo into bits. a giant panda's digestive system is more similar to that of a carnivore than an herbivore, and so much of what is eaten is passed as waste. to make up for the inefficient digestion, a panda needs to consume a comparatively large amount of food-from 20 to 40 pounds of bamboo each day-to get all its nutrients. to obtain this much food means that a panda must spend 10 to 16 hours a day foraging and eating. the rest of its time is spent mostly sleeping and resting. water: wild giant pandas get much of the water they need from bamboo, a grass whose contents are about half water. (new bamboo shoots are about 90 percent water.) but giant pandas need more water than what bamboo alone can provide. so almost every day wild pandas also drink fresh water from rivers and streams that are fed by melting snowfall in high mountain peaks. the temperate forests of central china where giant pandas live receive about 30 to 40 inches of rain and snow a year. charleston, west virginia-a city with a similar temperate climate-receives about the same amount of rain and snow: an average of 42.5 inches a year. reproduction: giant pandas reach breeding maturity between four and eight years of age. they may be reproductive until about age 20. female pandas ovulate only once a year, in the spring. a short period of two to three days around ovulation is the only time she is able to conceive. calls and scents draw males and females to each other. female giant pandas give birth between 95 and 160 days after mating. although females may give birth to two young, usually only one survives. giant panda cubs may stay with their mothers for up to three years before striking out on their own. this means a wild female, at best, can produce young only every other year; in her lifetime, she may successfully raise only five to eight cubs. the giant pandas' naturally slow breeding rate prevents a population from recovering quickly from illegal hunting, habitat loss, and other human-related causes of mortality. development: at birth, the cub is helpless, and it takes considerable effort on the mother's part to raise it. a newborn cub weighs three to five ounces and is about the size of a stick of butter. pink, hairless, and blind, the cub is 1/700th the size of its mother. except for a marsupial (such as the kangaroo or opossum), a giant panda baby is the smallest mammal newborn relative to its mother's size. cubs do not open their eyes until they are six to eight weeks of age and are not mobile until three months. a cub may nurse for eight to nine months. a cub is nutritionally weaned at one year, but not socially weaned for up to two years. lifestyle: a wild panda spends much of its day resting, feeding, and seeking food. unlike other bears from temperate climates, giant pandas do not hibernate. until recently, scientists thought giant pandas spent most of their lives alone, with males and females meeting only during the breeding season. recent studies paint a different picture, in which small groups of pandas share a large territory and sometimes meet outside the breeding season. much remains to be learned about the secret lives of these elusive animals, and every new discovery helps scientists in their battle to save this species. enrichment enrichment helps animals demonstrate their natural behavior, adds variety to their day, allows them exercise, gives them choices in their environment, and enhances their well-being. enrichment also gives zoo scientists the chance to study and observe the animals' behavior. what the scientists learn can benefit both zoo animals and wild animals. there are several different kinds of enrichment, including objects, sounds, and smells that challenge the animals, and stimulating and naturalistic enclosures. keepers work at varying the pandas' routine by preparing toys with an added twist: honey, apples, and leaf-eater biscuits are often put inside to provide a challenge. they are also sometimes given water bottles, blankets, burlap bags, and boxes. another option is the fruitsicle-frozen fruit juice and water, sometimes with cut up fruit. most of the pandas' toys are made of heavy-duty plastic, rubber, or bamboo since those are materials that can withstand the force of a bear whose jaws crush bamboo all day! a brief history of panda's at the zoo see the giant panda timeline at dinner in beijing in february 1972, first lady patricia nixon mentioned her fondness for giant pandas to chinese premier zhou enlai. eager for better relations with the u.s., zhou knew just what to say: "i'll give you some." on april 16, 1972, president and mrs. nixon formally welcomed giant pandas ling-ling (a female) and hsing-hsing (a male) to the smithsonian's national zoo. over the next 20 years, ling-ling and hsing-hsing produced five cubs. sadly, none of the offspring survived for more than a few days. but ever since their arrival, the pandas have symbolized cross-cultural collaboration between the united states and china. the arrival of giant pandas drew millions of fans from around the world to the zoo. more importantly, it gave the zoo an unparalleled opportunity to study giant panda behavior, health, and reproduction. specifically, it allowed scientists at the smithsonian conservation and biology institute to learn about panda estrus, breeding, pregnancy, pseudopregnancy and cub development. armed with this knowledge, the zoo became a leader in giant panda conservation and shared the information learned with other institutions that wanted to care for and breed this endangered species. on dec. 6, 2000, giant pandas mei xiang and tian tian arrived at the zoo. unlike ling-ling and hsing-hsing, however, the zoo's second pair of pandas are on loan. in exchange, the zoo contributes funds and expertise toward conservation efforts in china. the zoo reached an agreement with the chinese government, stipulating that the pair could live at the zoo for 10 years in exchange for $10 million. on jan. 20, 2011, zoo director dennis kelly and secretary general of the china wildlife conservation association zang chunlin signed a new giant panda cooperative research and breeding agreement, which stipulated that giant pandas mei xiang and tian tian would remain at the zoo until dec. 15, 2015. giant pandas will continue to live at the zoo through the end of 2020. the breeding agreement signed by zoo director dennis kelly and li qingwen, deputy secretary general of the china wildlife and conservation association (cwca), will take effect dec. 7, 2015, through dec. 7, 2020. in december 2011, david m. rubenstein donated $4.5 million to the zoo to fund the giant panda program through 2016. in appreciation, the giant panda complex-- home to giant pandas tian tian (male) and mei xiang (female)-- was named the david m. rubenstein family giant panda habitat. in addition, young conservation biologists in the u.s. and in china who were awarded zoo fellowships for their work to save this endangered species were named "david m. rubenstein fellows." the gift was used to fund conservation efforts in china, reproductive science, professional training programs, giant panda care at the zoo, upgrades to the zoo habitats and public education. mr. rubenstein provided an additional $4.5 million donation in fall 2015 to support the program through 2020. the gift allows the zoo to expand its educational outreach efforts and the zoo's animal care and the smithsonian conservation biology institute's scientific team to proceed with the five-year science plan established with their chinese colleagues from the china wildlife conservation association. the science plan has specific goals: to examine the creation and impact of corridors to link fragmented habitats that will benefit giant pandas and other wildlife species, including promoting genetic diversity; examine how to restore habitats, especially those where pandas appear to be making a comeback; provide advice on giant panda reintroduction; examine the potential impact of transmissible diseases on giant pandas and other wildlife species, including providing advice on implementing new programs associated with a wildlife disease control center being built in sichuan province; and continue research on giant panda reproduction and management, because, although there has been major success in chinese breeding centers, some pandas still experience reproductive challenges. × giant panda cubs at the national zoo 1972: ling-ling and hsing-hsing (shing-shing), the national zoo's first pair of giant pandas, arrived from china in april as a gift to the american people to commemorate president nixon's historic visit to china. during their 20 years together at the national zoo, this panda pair produced five cubs; none of the cubs survived. 1983: after a decade of trial and error, ling-ling and hsing-hsing mated for the first time. ling-ling was also artificially inseminated with semen from chia-chia (cha cha), a giant panda in london. on july 21, ling-ling gave birth to a male cub that died three hours later of pneumonia. using dna analysis, smithsonian conservation biology institute (scbi) scientists determined the cub was hsing-hsing's. 1984 – 1989: the pair went on to produce four more cubs during this time. one cub was stillborn in 1984. twins were born in 1987 - one died quickly from a lack of oxygen and the other succumbed to an infection four days later. the last cub, born in 1989, died of pneumonia 23 hours after birth. 1983 – 1991: in addition to the five pregnancies, ling-ling also experienced many pseudopregnancies. 1992: ling-ling died dec. 30, of heart failure; she was 23. 1999: hsing-hsing, suffering from several debilitating, age-related diseases, including terminal kidney disease, was euthanized nov. 28, 1999; he was 28. 2000: the national zoo's second pair of giant pandas, mei xiang (may-shong) and tian tian (tee-yen tee-yen), arrived in washington, d.c. dec. 6. an agreement reached with the chinese government stipulated that the pair would live at the national zoo for 10 years in exchange for $10 million. funds were raised from private donors, including lead corporate sponsor fujifilm, and exclusive media partner animal planet. 2003: mei xiang and tian tian attempted to mate, but were unsuccessful. 2004: scbi scientists vaginally inseminated mei xiang with tian tian's sperm during a non-anesthesia procedure after attempts at natural breeding were unsuccessful. mei xiang had a pseudopregnancy. 2005: scbi scientists and national zoo veterinarians artificially inseminated mei xiang march 11, after it was determined that no successful natural breeding occurred between the pandas during the previous 24 hours. mei xiang gave birth to the zoo's first surviving giant panda cub, tai shan, july 9, at 3:41 a.m. 2007: scbi scientists and national zoo veterinarians performed two artificial inseminations on mei xiang april 4 and 5. the procedures used semen collected from gao gao, the adult male at the san diego zoo. the procedures were unsuccessful and mei xiang had a pseudopregnancy. 2008: national zoo scientists and veterinarians performed an artificial insemination on mei xiang march 19, using fresh semen from tian tian. the procedures were unsuccessful and it is believed that mei xiang experienced either a pseudopregnancy or the loss of a developing fetus. 2009: scbi scientists artificially inseminated mei xiang jan. 17, using a very good quality semen sample from tian tian. the procedures were unsuccessful and mei xiang had a pseudopregnancy. 2010: scbi scientists artificially inseminated mei xiang jan. 9 and 10, using semen from tian tian. mei xiang had a pseudopregnancy. tai shan, the only surviving giant panda cub born at the national zoo, left for wolong nature reserve, china, feb. 4, to participate in breeding research. 2011: dennis kelly, director of the national zoo, and zang chunlin, secretary general of the china wildlife conservation association, signed a new giant panda cooperative research and breeding agreement jan. 20. the agreement stipulated that giant pandas mei xiang and tian tian would remain at the zoo until dec.15, 2015. mei xiang and tian tian's attempts at natural breeding jan. 29 were unsuccessful. reproductive experts from china and experts from scbi performed an artificial insemination with frozen semen collected from tian tian in 2005. a second artificial insemination was performed jan. 30. scbi scientists confirmed that mei xiang had a pseudopregnancy july 21. the national zoo announced that david m. rubenstein donated $4.5 million dec. 19, to fund its giant panda program through the end of 2015. it also announced that if mei xiang and tian tian failed to produce a cub in the 2012 breeding season, it was possible that both or one of the bears would return to china. 2012: a team of scbi scientists and chinese scientists artificially inseminated mei xiang april 29 and 30, using semen from tian tian collected and frozen in 2005, after attempts at natural breeding were unsuccessful. mei xiang gave birth to a cub sept. 16, at 10:46 p.m. the cub died sept. 23. necropsy results revealed that the cub was a female and she had under-developed lungs, which resulted in liver damage. 2013: mei xiang and tian tian attempted to mate march 29, but were unsuccessful. a team of scbi scientists and veterinarians, and chinese scientists performed two artificial inseminations on mei xiang march 30. the artificial inseminations used fresh semen and frozen semen from tian tian collected in 2003, and frozen semen collected in 2003 from the san diego zoo's panda gao gao. mei xiang gave birth to bao bao aug. 23 at 5:32 p.m. mei xiang gave birth to a second stillborn cub 26 hours later, but the cub was never viable. dna analysis confirmed that bao bao was sired

first lady of the united states and the first lady of the people's republic of china. want to learn about the panda cub and our reproductive science? click here when and why did the national zoo bring giant pandas back to washington? the zoo's two adult giant pandas arrived on december 6, 2000. ever since the national zoo received hsing-hsing and ling-ling from china in 1972 as part of president nixon's historic visit, scientists here have been leaders in the field of giant panda biology and conservation. the zoo is continuing that leadership through research involving the new pandas and research in china that will help save giant pandas in the wild. furthermore, giant pandas can inspire visitors to care for wildlife and threatened ecosystems around the world. they are ambassadors for conservation. what are their names? mei xiang (may shong), the female, means "beautiful fragrance" in chinese. tian tian (t-yen t-yen), the male, means "more and more." their male cub, born on july 9, 2005, was named tai shan (tie shon) by a public vote. his name means "peaceful mountain." he left the zoo for china on february 4, 2010. mei xiang gave birth to juvenile female, bao bao on august 23, 2013. her name means "precious treasure." on august 22, 2015, mei xiang gave birth to a male cub sired by tian tian. in a ceremony on sept. 25, 2015, first lady michelle obama and first lady of the peopleâ€™s republic of china, peng liyuan, named the cub bei bei, which means "precious, treasure" and is complementary to his sister, bao bao's name. how old are the pandas, and how much do they weigh? mei xiang was born on july 22, 1998, and tian tian was born on august 27, 1997. mei xiang weighs about 233 pounds, and tian tian weighs about 264 pounds. adult female pandas usually reach 220 pounds, and adult males 250 pounds. their first offspring, tai shan, weighed 184 pounds in february 2010. he left the zoo for china on february 4, 2010. bao bao weighs 140 pounds. how do the pandas handle the washington weather? giant pandas are adapted to living in high-altitude forests in the mountains of central china, and so they can easily deal with the wintry weather of washington. however, the heat and humidity of the summers here are more difficult for them. therefore, the zoo has installed air-conditioned grottos and misting sprays in their renovated outdoor enclosure so the pandas can stay outside all summer long, if they choose to. have they had any offspring? the national zoo is a world leader at breeding endangered species. our giant pandas are part of a breeding program that carefully matches potential giant panda parents in order to keep the population genetically healthy well into the future. on july 9, 2005, mei xiang gave birth to a cub. on october 17, when he was 100 days old, he was named tai shan by a vote open to the public. more than 200,000 votes were cast. he left the zoo for china on february 4, 2010. on september 16, 2012, mei xiang gave birth to a cub, who died on september 23, 2012 as a result of liver damage caused by underdeveloped lungs. on august 23, 2013, mei xiang gave birth to bao bao. on august 24, 2013, mei xiang gave birth to a stillborn cub. on august 22, 2015, mei xiang gave birth two cubs. on august 26, 2015 one of the two cubs died. the surviving cub is named bei bei. what will happen with any offspring? any baby born to mei xiang and tian tian belongs to china, and the zoo will send the offspring to china at about age four so that it can become part of the breeding population there. in december 2009, the zoo announced that tai shan would be sent to china in early 2010, per the zoo's agreement with the china wildlife conservation association. he left the zoo for china on february 4, 2010. what do they eat? in the wild, giant pandas eat bamboo almost exclusively. here at the zoo, they are fed bamboo as well as highly nutritious biscuits and carrots and apples. where do you get your bamboo? the zoo's department of nutrition grows bamboo at the smithsonian conservation biology institute. it also cuts bamboo from 15 stands located in the greater washington, d.c. area. can i donate bamboo? thanks for offering, but we don't accept bamboo donations. you can support the zoo's panda conservation efforts by donating online. donate now. do keepers go in the enclosures with the pandas? no. like any bear, giant pandas are very strong and potentially dangerous, so staff never go in an enclosure with them. how long will mei and tian be at the national zoo? mei xiang and tian tian belong to china and came to the zoo in 2000 for ten years as part of a research, conservation and breeding program. on january 20, 2011, a new agreement was signed (effective through december 5, 2015), stipulating that the zoo will conduct research in the areas of breeding and cub behavior. the first two years of the agreement include a cooperative study involving reproductive experts from the china conservation and research center for the giant panda in wolong, china, and the smithsonian conservation biology institute; they will oversee the breeding of mei xiang and tian tian. what is the status of giant pandas in the wild, and where do they live? giant pandas are an endangered species. they are difficult to census in the wild, but scientists believe there are about 1,864 remaining in the wild. these individuals live in scattered populations in central china, mostly in sichuan province, but also in gansu and shaanxi provinces. giant pandas specialize in eating bamboo, and so if the temperate bamboo forests in the mountains of central china continue to be cut down, there will be no room for giant pandas in the wild. this is why it is so crucial to support conservation research in china, and why we need to have a population of giant pandas in zoos as an insurance policy against extinction. what is a giant panda? the giant panda is a member of the bear family, which scientists call the ursidae. among the bears, it is most closely related to the spectacled bear of south america. what is a red panda? what is a lesser panda? the red panda, sometimes called the lesser panda, is a raccoon-sized mammal that lives in the same kind of habitat as giant pandas but over a larger area in asia. its fur is reddish and it eats bamboo. red pandas are not related to giant pandas. how long is the gestation period of a panda? panda gestation length ranges from three to six months, or 90 to 180 days, with an average pregnancy lasting 135 days. this wide variation in gestation occurs because the fertilized egg usually floats freely in the mother's uterus before it implants and begins developing. once the embryo is attached to the uterine wall, its development continues until a panda is born; newborn pandas are blind, very small and without almost any fur. a newborn panda is about three to five ounces. in american black bears, the actual period of time the embryo is developing after implantation is about eight weeks. pandas' actual development time is probably similar. much of a panda's physical development occurs after birth. what sounds do giant pandas make? pandas are solitary animals, but they vocalize extensively during social interactions. they "chirp" during mating and "honk" in distress. a "bleat" (a twittering goat sound) is a friendly contact call. a "chomp" (a rapid opening and closing of the mouth so the teeth audibly meet) is a mild defensive threat. a "bark" is used to scare an enemy. a squeal indicates submission or pain. i want to visit. tell me all the details. our website has plenty of information about visiting the zoo, including hours, parking, transportation, driving instructions, and more. admission to the zoo is free. how can people outside the washington area see the pandas? if you can't see our pandas in person, the easiest thing to do is click on the panda web cams. you can see live, streaming video of the pandas. but we also hope people from out of town can visit washington, d.c., and stop by sometime! how can i arrange to bring a tour or school group to the zoo to see the pandas? for tour groups, please contact guest services at 202.633.4888. how can i volunteer to work with pandas at the zoo? many people volunteer at the zoo. for complete information, including whom to contact, read about volunteering with fonz and the zoo. i have to write a school report on pandas. can you help? you will find all the information you need for your report on pandas on the internet. start with giant panda facts then surf around the other giant panda pages on our website. can you send information and activities on giant pandas? all our information on giant pandas is located on this website. we have no additional information to send you. how do i send a panda e-card? just go here to send a panda e-card. why aren't the panda cams working? if the cams are still not working, it could be that they are temporarily down for repairs or adjustments. or, too many people may be trying to view the cams at one time. in either case, check back in a little while or download the zoo app. newsroom·

giving champions of conservation join the smithsonian campaign ways to help join friends of the national zoo (fonz) adopt a species volunteer home science scbi front royal campus about us science education related resources front royal campus the smithsonian conservation biology institute in front royal (formerly the conservation and research center) started primarily as a breeding center for endangered birds and mammals. today, the black-footed ferret, eld's deer, and several species of pacific island birds are being bred to maintain genetic diversity and provide reserves for highly endangered species. the current priority for scbi's animal collection is veterinary and reproductive research. by living in controlled environments, the birds and mammals—most of them little-known and endangered—provide ideal subjects for intensive study and the rapid acquisition of urgently needed information. findings from these studies provide critical information for the management of captive populations and valuable insights for the conservation and management of wild populations. not all the animals that reside at scbi front royal are endangered. some are "surrogate species," with behavioral and physiological characteristics similar to their endangered relatives in the wild. scbi scientists study the captive proxies to design methodologies that can be used to solve complex problems affecting their wild counterparts. for example, scbi's intensive studies of the siberian polecat paved the way for a more effective reintroduction of the black-footed ferret, the most endangered mammal in the united states, to its native western habitat. more similarly, scbi is using surrogate bird species to help learn more about how to conserve many critically endangered hawaiian birds. with the facility in front royal as their operational hub, scbi scientists study the ecology of native wildlife and habitats within the appalachian ecosystem. among their many projects, they have investigated the effects of timber removal on species that live in forest communities of virginia, completed a mammal survey of the allegheny mountains in western virginia, and conducted intensive research on the ecology and management of white-tailed deer populations. more much of scbi's local research has been ongoing for decades. because ecological processes are highly complex—indeed, life and the world are dynamic and ever-changing—it is only with long-term records that many trends can be deciphered. scbi's kentucky warbler study is a good example. scientists have been monitoring this small migratory bird for more than 20 years, investigating its breeding behavior and ecology in virginia during summers and its wintering ecology in central america. this study has been invaluable in interpreting a complex system through space and time, with countless benefits for many other migratory birds. newsroom events volunteers careers & internships contact about us

nutrition laboratory the national zoo's nutrition laboratory, part of scbi rock creek, was the first of its kind in a u.s. zoo. the nutrition lab focuses on comparative nutrition and nutritional ecology and has conducted extensive research into lactation strategies for a wide variety of animals. it also is involved in long-term projects on nutrition and reproduction. genetics laboratory the genetics laboratory uses molecular genetic methods to support studies in systematics, population genetics, and behavioral ecology. much of our research is directly applicable to concerns of conservation biology and relevant to endangered species and biodiversity issues. the genetics laboratory is equipped with tools for these research questions. amazonia science gallery the amazonia science gallery, located adjacent to the amazonia habitat exhibit, is open to the public to offer a glimpse into the scientific research zoo and other smithsonian staff conduct in the lab and in the field. it features several working laboratories that allow visitors to see and informally interact with scientists as they go about their research and studies. the gallery’s gis (geographic information system) lab is a collaborative research venture to use the tools of gis in creating an interactive, web-based resource for amazon conservation. the program endeavors to display various maps of the amazon basin with overlapping layers of conservation activity (protected areas, indigenous areas, etc.) and selected vectors and effects of development (mining, road development, fire data, etc.). the gallery’s molecular genetics lab is a satellite lab of the main molecular genetics laboratory, a research group within the department of systematic biology at the national museum of natural history. the lab was founded in 1991 as part of the national zoological park, but recently was moved administratively under the natural history museum. eventually, the laboratory will move from the national zoo to the natural history building on the mall, and join with other researchers using molecular methods for studies of evolution and conservation. the gallery also has a satellite lab for the department’s nutrition lab. here visitors can view the equipment needed for scientists to prepare nutritional samples for analyses. at the gallery’s biodiversity laboratory visitors are introduced to the tremendous diversity of life by way of the microscopic examination of preserved and living specimens. the water chemistry and integrated pest management stations in the lab allow staff and visitors to monitor the environmental conditions necessary to maintain the rainforest and river system next door in the amazonia habitat exhibit. department of reproductive sciences at the zoo in northwest washington, d.c., are state-of-the-art reproductive sciences facility and genome resource bank. also at the zoo are facilities for conducting research on animals in the collection and coordinating conservation programs. newsroom events volunteers careers & internships contact about us privacy copyright help

teaching students and the public about conservation biology and how genetic theory and methods contribute to its ends. research programs genetic management of wild and captive populations genetic deterioration due to inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity is a very real problem that increases the risk of extinction in both wild and zoo populations. cceg scientists have long been leaders in developing the science and tools for genetic management of endangered species learn more. non-invasive dna techniques to conserve endangered species effectively, scientists and managers need basic information  such as where the animals live  and how many of them there are. however, many endangered species are hard to find and even harder to count because they are rare and often secretive. cceg has developed genetic methods for obtaining reliable information on many elusive endangered species by analyzing dna extracted from feces, hair, and other items shed in the wild. learn more. ancient dna it is often difficult or impossible to obtain materials suitable for traditional dna analysis from endangered and extinct species. in this case, cceg’s genetics laboratory has optimized a set of careful, controlled protocols to isolate and analyze dna from older materials including museum specimens, mineralized bones (bones that aren’t completely fossilized), and archaeological artifacts. learn more. systematics and definition of conservation units conservation strategies require knowing the taxonomic units that are to be preserved and how unique they are. is a population a distinct subspecies or species? how much gene flow is there between two geographically isolated populations? how different are populations or species and which one’s extinction would most impact genetic diversity? dna analyses can be extremely useful for answering these types of questions. learn more. disease diagnosis and dynamics emerging diseases can be devastating to wildlife, both in nature and in zoos, and some of these epizootic (epidemic) diseases have also become major health problems for humans. cceg studies the effects of pathogenic organisms on wildlife, and develops and applies molecular methods for diagnosing diseases and determining genetic variation in a wide range of pathogen types. learn more. genetic applications to understanding animal behavior and ecology studies of animal behavior and ecology can benefit from the use of genetic methods. scientists can use genetic data to estimate the level of kinship of individuals, which can be used to help explain the behaviors of individuals in families and expanded social groups. cceg has participated in numerous collaborative studies of behavior with nzp and other scientists. learn more. newsroom events volunteers careers & internships contact about us privacy copyright help

vanderbilt was in his 79th year when he decided to make the gift that founded vanderbilt university in the spring of 1873. the $1 million that he gave to endow and build the university was the commodore's only major philanthropy. methodist bishop holland n. mctyeire of nashville, husband of amelia townsend who was a cousin of the commodore's young second wife frank crawford, went to new york for medical treatment early in 1873 and spent time recovering in the vanderbilt mansion. he won the commodore's admiration and support for the project of building a university in the south that would "contribute to strengthening the ties which should exist between all sections of our common country." mctyeire chose the site for the campus, supervised the construction of buildings and personally planted many of the trees that today make vanderbilt a national arboretum. at the outset, the university consisted of one main building (now kirkland hall), an astronomical observatory and houses for professors. landon c. garland was vanderbilt's first chancellor, serving from 1875 to 1893. he advised mctyeire in selecting the faculty, arranged the curriculum and set the policies of the university. for the first 40 years of its existence, vanderbilt was under the auspices of the methodist episcopal church, south. the vanderbilt board of trust severed its ties with the church in june 1914 as a result of a dispute with the bishops over who would appoint university trustees. from the outset, vanderbilt met two definitions of a university: it offered work in the liberal arts and sciences beyond the baccalaureate degree and it embraced several professional schools in addition to its college. james h. kirkland, the longest serving chancellor in university history (1893-1937), followed chancellor garland. he guided vanderbilt to rebuild after a fire in 1905 that consumed the main building, which was renamed in kirkland's honor, and all its contents. he also navigated the university through the separation from the methodist church. notable advances in graduate studies were made under the third chancellor, oliver cromwell carmichael (1937-46). he also created the joint university library, brought about by a coalition of vanderbilt, peabody college and scarritt college. remarkable continuity has characterized the government of vanderbilt. the original charter, issued in 1872, was amended in 1873 to make the legal name of the corporation "the vanderbilt university." the charter has not been altered since. the university is self-governing under a board of trust that, since the beginning, has elected its own members and officers. the university's general government is vested in the board of trust. the immediate government of the university is committed to the chancellor, who is elected by the board of trust. the original vanderbilt campus consisted of 75 acres. by 1960, the campus had spread to about 260 acres of land. when george peabody college for teachers merged with vanderbilt in 1979, about 53 acres were added. vanderbilt's student enrollment tended to double itself each 25 years during the first century of the university's history: 307 in the fall of 1875; 754 in 1900; 1,377 in 1925; 3,529 in 1950; 7,034 in 1975. in the fall of 1999 the enrollment was 10,127. in the planning of vanderbilt, the assumption seemed to be that it would be an all-male institution. yet the board never enacted rules prohibiting women. at least one woman attended vanderbilt classes every year from 1875 on. most came to classes by courtesy of professors or as special or irregular (non-degree) students. from 1892 to 1901 women at vanderbilt gained full legal equality except in one respect -- access to dorms. in 1894 the faculty and board allowed women to compete for academic prizes. by 1897, four or five women entered with each freshman class. by 1913 the student body contained 78 women, or just more than 20 percent of the academic enrollment. national recognition of the university's status came in 1949 with election of vanderbilt to membership in the select association of american universities. in the 1950s vanderbilt began to outgrow its provincial roots and to measure its achievements by national standards under the leadership of chancellor harvie branscomb. by its 90th anniversary in 1963, vanderbilt for the first time ranked in the top 20 private universities in the united states. vanderbilt continued to excel in research, and the number of university buildings more than doubled under the leadership of chancellors alexander heard (1963-1982) and joe b. wyatt (1982-2000), only the fifth and sixth chancellors in vanderbilt's long and distinguished history. heard added three schools (blair, the owen graduate school of management and peabody college) to the seven already existing and constructed three dozen buildings. during wyatt's tenure, vanderbilt acquired or built one-third of the campus buildings and made great strides in diversity, volunteerism and technology. the university grew and changed significantly under its seventh chancellor, gordon gee, who served from 2000 to 2007. vanderbilt led the country in the rate of growth for academic research funding, which increased to more than $450 million and became one of the most selective undergraduate institutions in the country. on march 1, 2008, nicholas s. zeppos was named vanderbilt's eighth chancellor after serving as interim chancellor beginning aug. 1, 2007. prior to that, he spent 2002-2008 as vanderbilt's provost, overseeing undergraduate, graduate and professional education programs as well as development, alumni relations and research efforts in liberal arts and sciences, engineering, music, education, business, law and divinity. he first came to vanderbilt in 1987 as an assistant professor in the law school. in his first five years, zeppos led the university through the most challenging economic times since the great depression, while continuing to attract the best students and faculty from across the country and around the world. vanderbilt got through the economic crisis notably less scathed than many of its peers and began and remained committed to its much-praised enhanced financial aid policy for all undergraduates during the same timespan. the martha rivers ingram commons for first-year students opened in 2008 and college halls, the next phase in the residential education system at vanderbilt, is on track to open in the fall of 2014. during zeppos' first five years, vanderbilt has drawn robust support from federal funding agencies, and the medical center entered into agreements with regional hospitals and health care systems in middle and east tennessee that will bring vanderbilt care to patients across the state. today, vanderbilt university is a private research university of about 6,500 undergraduates and 5,300 graduate and professional students. the university comprises 10 schools, a distinguished medical center, a public policy center and the freedom forum first amendment center. vanderbilt offers undergraduate programs in the liberal arts and sciences, engineering, music, education and human development as well as a full range of graduate and professional degrees. the university is consistently ranked as one of the nation's top 20 universities by publications such as u.s. news & world report, with several programs and disciplines ranking in the top 10. the combination of cutting-edge research, liberal arts and a distinguished medical center creates an invigorating atmosphere where students tailor their education to meet their goals and researchers collaborate to solve complex questions affecting our health, culture and society. vanderbilt, an independent, privately supported university, and the separate, non-profit vanderbilt university medical center share a respected name and enjoy close collaboration through education and research.

distinguished history while simultaneously planning strategically for our bright future. this has positioned us advantageously to take actions that will bring even greater success and recognition in the future. by adapting to the changing health care environment, we can ensure that vanderbilt university and vumc not only continue, but also enhance their extraordinary service to the world and care of our patients. in november 2014, vanderbilt’s board of trust directed the institution’s senior leadership to reconfigure vumc as a not-for-profit academic medical center that is financially distinct from vanderbilt university. however, the two organizations will remain tightly woven together by mission and the respected vanderbilt name. the mission of vumc will not change. it will continue to be the pinnacle of medical excellence, and be one of the world’s preeminent academic medical centers. -chancellor nicholas s. zeppos read more »   fall 2015 opportunities for information fall faculty

months. if after reviewing the information on this page you still have questions, please  contact your admissions officer. we assign admissions officers based on the high school from which you graduated. requirements admission to vanderbilt as a transfer student is highly competitive and based on a number of factors, but it all begins with academic merit. typically, admitted transfer students have a gpa of a b+/a- or higher, along with competitive test scores, involvement in their current college community, and a compelling reason why vanderbilt is the right place for them to complete their undergraduate degree. students from accredited institutions are welcome to apply for transfer admission. vanderbilt considers you a transfer student if you have completed the equivalent of at least 12 semester hours of credit, after completing high school (high school degree or ged). courses taken as dual-enrollment do not count towards these hours if those credits are being used to graduate from your high school program. admitted transfer students are required to be enrolled for at least four semesters (60 credit hours) to earn a degree from vanderbilt university. since we are a residential campus community, our admission process gives preference to students who have been able to show full-time engagement and full-time enrollment in a similar campus community at their current institution. all parts of the application (academics, test scores, extracurricular involvement, essay, recommendation letters etc.) will be considered as we make our decisions. because you apply to a specific school at vanderbilt, fit for a particular school/program will also be considered. interviews are not offered to transfer applicants, but our office remains available to answer questions you may have about the application process or our campus community and academic opportunities. school-specific admissions vanderbilt admits both first-time applicants and transfer applicants to one of our four undergraduate schools:  college of arts and science, school of engineering, peabody college, or the blair school of music. on your application you’ll specify to which school you are applying, and

four undergraduate schools, the college of arts and science is home to 49 disciplinary and interdisciplinary majors that encompass the humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences.

top 3 graduate schools of education in the united states. peabody excels in preparing students for classroom teaching, research, service, and many other fields. if you apply to peabody college you

of engineering the vanderbilt university school of engineering proudly educates students who change the world and make it a better place through the use of technology. while you are not admitted to a specific major in the school of engineering, a strong background in science and math (specifically physics and calculus) is critical for competitive applicants. students seeking a second bachelor’s degree may apply to the school of engineering, but it is encouraged that you speak with the engineering dean’s office to determine your best academic plan – and if a second undergraduate degree is the most appropriate route. blair school of music the blair school of music offers conservatory level training in a strong liberal arts environment. as the only music school in the top twenty universities

three. what are they? aetna plus, aetna select, and aetna healthfund what’s the same about them? all three options: • allow you to see providers and specialists without a referral • provide 100% coverage for preventive care and screenings, with no deductible or co-pay required, as long as the service meets the guidelines for a preventive care service and is not for screening of a diagnosis • have three networks: -vanderbilt health affiliated network. (tier 1) for details, see vu.edu/vhan. -in-network, aetna “pos ii” national network (tier 2) -out-of-network. these providers may be used, but you will not have the advantage of the network discount. (tier 3) what’s different about the plans? the premiums, copays and deductibles are all different. refer to the benefits overview or the summary of benefits and coverage (sbc) for each health plan. required by law, sbcs provide an easy-to-understand summary about each health plan’s benefits and coverage. visit vanderbilt’s health plan page and click on the links for each health plan’s sbc or contact the employee service center to request a printed copy. where can i find premiums? at the end of the benefits overview. what are bands? ranges of annual base benefits rates of pay that determine how much you will pay for your portion of health insurance premiums. in most cases, your annual base benefits rate (abbr) is the same as your annual salary. there are five bands: band 1: for employees with salaries up to $49,999.99 band 2: for employees with salaries of $50,000-99,999.99 band 3: for employees with salaries of $100,000-149,999.99 band 4: for employees with salaries of $150,000-199,999.99 band 5: for employees with salaries of $200,000 or more what’s my copay? that depends on what plan you choose, what tier your service falls into, and what kind of service you receive. for specifics, refer to pages 4-6 of the benefits overview. what are tiers? vanderbilt’s aetna-administered plans give you a choice of in-network and out-of-network providers by providing benefits under three tiers: • tier 1 -vanderbilt health affiliated network (vhan), vanderbilt’s preferred network. you will save the most money when you use in-network providers.  • tier 2 – aetna national network • tier 3 – out of network you can use aetna’s docfind to search for a provider. will my premiums come out of each paycheck? if you are paid monthly, your premiums will come out of each paycheck all at once. if you are paid weekly or bi-weekly, these amounts will be divided equally between your four or two paychecks of each month. what’s the best way to decide which plan to choose? choosing your health plan is a personal decision. read the benefits overview thoroughly and visit vanderbilt’s health plan page to help you decide. the summary of benefits and coverage (sbc) for each plan provides an easy-to-understand summary about benefits and coverage. sbcs are found on vanderbilt’s health plan page. to request a printed copy, call the employee service center. alex is a virtual benefits counselor that can help you select the health plan option that’s best for you and your family. just answer a few questions about how you think you will use your coverage and alex will give you a custom recommendation. go to ask alex. what percentage of my health insurance premium does vanderbilt pay for? vanderbilt shares a significant portion of the monthly cost. the percentage will depend on your band and which plan you choose. on average, vanderbilt contributes 77 percent towards employee premiums. are the plans the same for staff/faculty/house staff? the benefits overview provides information for staff. some programs’ guidelines and eligibility vary for faculty, house staff and post-docs. if you fall into one of these categories, refer to your manual for guidance. what happens if i don’t enroll in any health plan? if you are fully benefits-eligible, you will be automatically enrolled in the aetna plus employee-only option, unless you make changes within 30 days of your hire date. if you do not want to elect coverage through vanderbilt, you must waive the benefit in my vu benefits to avoid payroll deductions. why did i receive a cobra general notice as a new hire or newly-benefits eligible employee?

the fee encourages spouses and partners to take the coverage offered by their employers. we recognize there are circumstances where the vanderbilt university plan is more attractive – whether for family convenience, providers, or cost. in that case, the $100 per month fee would apply. some organizations do not offer coverage for spouses/partners with other health insurance options. at vanderbilt university, only spouses/partners with access to health insurance through an outside employer, including vanderbilt university medical center, would pay the fee. we compared this cost with other employers and learned that for the majority, the fee is $100 per month. this amount keeps the university aligned with similar-sized organizations and is enough to encourage people to consider other available health insurance options with their employer. if my spouse/same-sex domestic partner is currently covered on his or her employer's health plan, and he or she loses that coverage, am i able to add them to my vanderbilt plan? yes. your spouse/partner's loss of coverage would be considered a qualifying event. you should declare a life event in my vu benefits, and the fee will be waived. you may be audited and required to submit documentation proving your qualifying event– and there are limitations in allowable changes. see life/work changes  for more information. if my spouse/same-sex domestic partner enrolls in his or her employer's health plan, can he or she stay on my vanderbilt health plan and use it as secondary coverage? yes, they can remain on your vanderbilt health plan, but you will pay the coverage fee. however, we generally do not recommend carrying secondary coverage. if my spouse/same-sex domestic partner is also a vanderbilt  university employee, but we choose to enroll on one plan, will i be charged the fee? no, the fee only applies to spouse/partners who do not work at vanderbilt university, but are offered employer-sponsored coverage. if your spouse or partner works for vanderbilt university medical center (not vanderbilt university), the coverage fee will apply. my spouse/same-sex domestic partner has health insurance available through his or her employer, but the employer requires payment of the full cost of the insurance. does the fee apply in this case? yes, the coverage fee would apply, because the employer offers the coverage. if am widowed or divorced during the calendar year 2016, and i am paying the coverage fee, will the fee be discontinued during the year under either of these circumstances? yes, you should declare a life event in my vu benefits, and the fee will be discontinued. if my spouse/partner has medicare and is covered by my vanderbilt insurance, will i have to pay the coverage fee? no, medicare coverage is not considered employer-sponsor coverage, so the fee would not apply. my spouse works part-time at vanderbilt university, but also for another employer that offers benefits. if i elect employee+spouse coverage for us both, will i have to pay the spousal coverage fee? yes, because your spouse is eligible for coverage through the other employer, you will pay the spousal coverage fee if you add your spouse to your coverage. you would not need to pay the fee if your spouse only worked part-time at vanderbilt university. if your spouse or partner works for vanderbilt university medical center (not vanderbilt university), the coverage fee will apply. if my spouse/same-sex domestic partner works for vanderbilt university medical center, but we choose to enroll in just the vanderbilt university plan, will i be charged the fee? yes, effective april 30, 2016, vanderbilt university medical center is a separate employer. you will pay the spousal coverage fee if you add your spouse to your vanderbilt university coverage, just like you would for other employers. if i earn less than normal during a pay period and my paycheck does not cover my premium deduction, how can i pay the balance? if this happens, the unpaid balance will be automatically deducted from your next paycheck. you do not need to take any action. same-sex marriages are now performed and legal in all u.s. states. will this affect same-sex domestic partner coverage? because same-sex marriages are now performed and legal in all u.s. states, married same-sex couples are eligible for the same benefits and tax advantages as other married couples. we will continue to offer fully benefits eligible same-sex domestic partners and their children access to vanderbilt benefit programs, including insurance plans and tuition assistance, in 2016. however, only spouses and natural, step- and adopted children will be eligible in 2017. this updated eligibility also extends to fmla protection.the portion of your medical, dental, and vision premiums for your same-sex spouse will not be treated as taxable income as it was for partners. i regularly work 20 hours per week, but my work schedule is inconsistent throughout the year. i could go months without working. how will i pay insurance premiums when i am not working? if you will not be working for a month or more, you should request your department place you on unpaid leave. once on unpaid leave, you can make payments through direct billing with vanderbilt’s benefit administrator, benefit express. if your department keeps you in an active status, but you happen to not work for a month or so, any premiums you missed will be collected from the next pay check you receive. you will pay the same premium amount on leave as you do when you are activity working, even though you will pay through direct billing. does vanderbilt offer help if i’m trying to quit using tobacco?

http://www.mtv.com:80/news/2279807/sean-diddy-combs-ap-child-prostitution-victims-language/?utm_source=change_org&utm_medium=petition/	diddy thinks we need to stop saying 'child prostitute' immediately - mtv			 mtv menu mtv mtv home tv provider signout news news music getty issues diddy thinks we need to stop saying ‘child prostitute’ immediately words matter. by katherine speller 9/23/2015 on tuesday night sean ’diddy’ combs tweeted a petition asking the associated press to stop using the phrases “child prostitute” and “child prostitution” in their style guides and news stories. “they are victims [and] survivors of rape,” he wrote, sharing a link to the change.org campaign from the d.c.-based human rights project for girls (rights4girls). dear @ap, there’s #nosuchthing as a ‘child prostitute.’ they are victims + survivors of rape. please sign + share: http://t.co/egixb76ro0 — sean diddy combs (@iamdiddy) september 22, 2015 because the terms deal with the issue of people who are too young to consent to sex, let alone sex work, the group argues that saying “child prostitute” or “child sex worker” is both insensitive and factually inaccurate. instead, the group suggests that outlets refer to these children as “victims and survivors of child rape.” “when we refer to children and youth who are bought and sold for sex, who are not even of the legal age to consent, we cannot call them child prostitutes,” rights4girls executive director malika saada saar told mtv news. “the term really denies a lot of the suffering and the injury that happens to kids that are bought and sold. it suggests that these kids are doing it because they want to do it. not only does it imply choice, agency and consent — it implies criminality. when, in reality, they are the ones that have been hurt.” this is where the law messes up when talking about sexual violence author withelma “t” ortiz walker pettigrew writes in the petition that she was “sexually exploited” from the age of 10 to 17 throughout the u.s. and, ultimately, arrested and jailed on prostitution charges. “i was 10,” she writes. “and girls like me are beaten, kidnapped, gang raped and tortured into selling our bodies to adults, every night. this is not about choice. this is about abuse and rape.” pettigrew further notes that there have been “5,000 instances in the past five years when reporters for print, wire and online outlets have used the phrase ’child prostitute,’ ’child prostitution,’ ’underage prostitution’ or other variations on the phrase to describe these exploited children.” word choice like this can compound stigma and guilt for survivors, as well as contribute to misconceptions about sex work in general — both from the public and law enforcement. according to fbi crime data, there were 609 people under the age of 18 arrested for “prostitution and commercialized vice” in 2012. “kids who are subject to commercial rape are arrested and put into the juvenile justice system, not a public health system,” saar said. “we don’t do that with any other child who is abused. we have to come to a place where we stop criminalizing kids for being subject to rape.” such criminalization also disproportionately affected african-americans, who comprised 59.4% of the aforementioned 2012 arrests. “we have the school-to-prison pipeline, but there’s also a sex abuse to prison pipeline — and a black and brown girls pipeline for girls arrested for sexual abuse,” saar said. “it’s important to understand the particular way black and brown girls are criminalized through being subject to commercial rape … it says a lot about who is allowed to be a child and who is allowed to be a victim of abuse — and clearly african-american children are allowed neither.” here’s how your youtube faves are fighting sexual abuse online and irl while the conversation regarding which words the people involved in sex work prefer to use is ongoing — and there’s no one-size-fits-all term — many consenting adults find “sex worker” to be a more humanizing and sensitive option. but when it comes to children — who absolutely cannot consent to any kind of sex work — it’s vital to center conversations around helping survivors and victims. “language has power,” saar said. “we have to stop talking about these girls as being criminals as prostitutes and understand they are survivors and victims of rape — child rape — and that’s how they deserve to be treated.” your daily dose of the latest news get the mtv news app today. katherine speller view related posts around the web powered by zergnet zergnet news about archive faq/help jobs terms of use privacy policy/privacy rights copyright closed captioning eventful partners ad choices ©2016 viacom international inc. all rights reserved. mtv and all related titles and logos are trademarks of viacom international inc.

joining the growing number of major u.s. grocery chains that are moving toward selling only cage-free eggs - eventually. the san antonio-based grocery chain quietly announced last week that it is working toward selling only cage-free eggs by 2025. it's following the lead of competitors such as brookshire's, kroger and wal-mart, which announced two weeks ago that it also plans to make the transition by 2025. "h-e-b will continue to work closely with suppliers to move toward 100% cage-free eggs by 2025, provided we have adequate supply, sufficient consumer demand and pricing is affordable for our customers," the company said in a posting on its website friday. "we recognize that the transition costs for our egg farmers to migrate to cage-free systems are significant and will require time to implement," h-e-b says on its website. animal rights groups such as mercy for animals and the humane society of the united states have been pressuring h-e-b to switch to cage-free eggs only. such eggs have also grown in popularity amid growing public concern over antibiotic use in commercial egg production as well as increasing distaste for the living conditions of hens highlighted in documentaries like the 2005 film "earthlings." h-e-b's policy on its egg suppliers has been under review for at least seven years as consumers increasingly demanded and were willing to pay higher prices for cage-free eggs, h-e-b spokeswoman dya campos said. maintaining the affordability of eggs is a priority for the grocer, however, and cage-free eggs are more expensive than standard eggs, she said. "we made the commitment to study this and move in this direction by 2025 as long as it doesn't impact the affordability of eggs for texans," she said. eggs are an important source of protein for many families, and some food assistance programs, like the women, infants and children program, don't cover the cost of cage-free eggs in texas, she said. the humane society notified the company that it planned to run an ad tuesday in h-e-b's hometown newspaper, the san antonio express-news, criticizing the company's practices, said matthew prescott, the organization's senior director of food policy. the ad, which didn't run, called the company "one of the only major grocery chains in america that's allowing its egg suppliers to continue locking chickens in cages indefinitely." mercy for animals also ran ads on facebook criticizing h-e-b's egg policy, handed out leaflets in front of the chain's stores in the u.s. and mexico and started a petition on change.org. company executives never met with either group, campos said, adding that the policy change wasn't a result of their campaigns. "the change of the wording on our website has nothing to do with this group," she said. "they probably took notice to that yesterday and are trying to take credit for it today."   latest news kbr finds success as it continues to readjust firm leads hdc market camden execs: houston apartment market getting worse ymca in the works at falls at imperial oaks cleburne cafeteria joins this list of bygone businesses... cardtronics seeks to move parent company's incorporation locale construction on crystal lagoon project starts in dallas area randalls seeks variance to expand midtown store academy sports + outdoors opens distribution center in tennessee it's time to drain our tax swamp get news sent to you choose from our most popular newsletters below. or, visit www.chron.com/newsletters to see more options. breaking news morning news update bayou city buzz (evening) preview: weekly houston entertainment guide e-mail:   latest videos small business does bankruptcy of a business stop lawsuit settlements? how to check the access list in cisco pix accounting methods & disadvantages how to start a system recovery from a password locked computer how to create a business plan for expansion most read 1 stafford mourning baseball coach michael mesa's death 2 john mcclain's texans draft report card 3 texans agree to deals with 16 undrafted free agents 4 texans take ohio state receiver braxton miller in third round 5 san marcos, texas photographer shares 'haunting' photos of... 6 new hooters coming to pearland 7 prince tribute-themed sportscast gets anchor fired 8 houston dodges worst of storms; areas to north harder hit 9 us 59 inbound reopened after accident shut down all lanes for... 10 alleged drunk driver rear-ends car, kills man in sw houston view comments © 2016 hearst communications, inc. logo return to top about our company careers advertise with us ad choices terms & conditions privacy policy your california privacy rights contact customer service newsroom contacts connect email newsletter facebook twitter pinterest google instagram subscribe ipad app houstonchronicle.com houston chronicle archives eedition demo today's eedition hearst newspapers © copyright hearst newspapers, llc 00000000

(photo: courtesy clarissa lindsey) on tuesday, gov. rick scott signed into law a bill that would require engineers to install traffic barriers along bodies of water near state roads. the bill, hb 7061, contains a provision called chloe’s law, named after 21-year-old ucf student chloe arenas, who drowned june 28, 2015, after crashing her car into a retention pond near alafaya trail and state road 408 around 5 a.m. the chloe’s law provision would require the florida department of transportation to add barriers to state roads adjacent to bodies of water in which a drowning death occurred between july 1, 2006, and july 1, 2016. the barriers must be installed by by june 30, 2018. tyler yeargain, the ucf student government association legislative affairs coordinator, said chloe’s law passed with unprecedented speed, having only gone through one legislative session. “typically, when there’s legislation that is proposed in response to a death, it takes a couple years for all the kinks in the bill to be worked out,” yeargain said. “even though they’re not typically controversial, they’re typically not high priority, so there’s typically not a reason for them to move through the legislature all that quickly.” yeargain said this was a special circumstance he attributes to the ucf community, and the clout it holds at the state level and among government relations consultants at gray robinson and sen. darren soto. the only way the bill could be stopped at this point, yeargain explained, would be for someone to challenge its constitutionality but that’s unlikely to happen. central florida future ucf student's death sparks petition to protect drivers the chloe’s law provision began as a change.org petition started by arenas’ friend clarissa lindsey in july 2015. lindsey petitioned the florida legislature to have guardrails installed near bodies of water. her petition garnered the attention soto, who helped turn the petition into actual legislation. sen. soto was joined by representative rene “coach p” plasencia, a ucf alumnus, who lamented the number of traffic accidents that occur in florida. “no parent should ever have to bury their child,” plasencia said in a press release. “with chloe’s law’s passage, we can begin to take steps necessary to ensure florida has the safest roadways.” florida leads the nation in vehicle-related drowning deaths, according to a 2011 study by the national highway traffic safety administration. between 2004 and 2008, the state experienced 57 vehicle-related drownings, followed by california with 49 and texas with 31. nearly 2.1 percent of all traffic fatalities in florida during this period involved drowning, according to the study. “in a perfect world, this law would prevent all submerged vehicle drownings,” lindsey said. “unfortunately, that just isn’t realistic. i am confident it will save many lives, but i think it’s important to realize that the work is not complete. in order to be a successful law, we must continually revisit the process and amend what we can to make it even more beneficial.” when she first heard the bill had passed, lindsey said she felt numb and overwhelmed with a sense of peace. lindsey said that the process of getting chloe’s law passed has kept her focused on getting through each day, but now she can finally start the mourning process. central florida future fla. legislature, 5k to support chloe’s law “we have been working tirelessly to continue advocating for chloe’s law,” lindsey said in a previous interview with the future. “sen. darren soto has committed to sponsoring the law in the senate, and we are still working to go forth with the same process with the house of representatives.” though chloe’s law has passed, lindsey doesn’t feel her work is complete. “chloe’s family and i established the non profit foundation for chloe’s law,” lindsey said. “ideally, we would like to begin setting up fundraisers for students who share the same passion for animals as chloe did. chloe’s mom has also been discussing how beneficial it would be to educate drivers on the importance of not driving when you’re tired ... i will continue to honor chloe every day of my life through everything i do. i have a guardian angel to make proud.” this story was originally published on april 19, 2016.  ----- bernard wilchusky is the editor-in-chief of

http://www.mtv.com:80/news/2156957/sexual-assault-language/	this is where the law messes up when talking about sexual violence - mtv			 mtv menu mtv mtv home tv provider signout news news music getty issues this is where the law messes up when talking about sexual violence there's no one-size-fits-all term for a person who's encountered trauma. by katherine speller 5/11/2015 “something bad happened to me.” that’s the way eric stiles was able to wrap his mind around it all in the beginning — it was “something bad,” an amorphous problem that didn’t have a name. when he was a child, his older brother molested him. years later, when he was 16 and the police officers came to investigate, the words he heard for the charges against his brother were “deviant sexual behavior.” this came from an unsympathetic police officer, who told him not to “ruin his brother’s life,” and even threatened to charge stiles the same way. those words were stuck in stiles’ head for a long time — long after the investigation yielded no results, after his brother was not charged, and long after he left home to pursue a career in the military. the three words let him continue to blame himself for what happened to him, he said. they made it seem like he was part of the crime, rather than the victim. and, paired with the societal stigma surrounding male rape victims/survivors, they caused him even more grief. in searching for the perfect rape case, rolling stone may have revealed the truth about sexual assault survivors “back then, rape was something that happened to women, not to men — and still, in a lot of places, it’s [seen] like that,” stiles said. “after i tried getting some help and seeking some support later in life, and i was told it was ‘child molestation,’ it didn’t make sense.” getty because in those years, with all the words thrown around by the police and all the emotional turmoil, he said there were just two truths he desperately needed to hear and have confirmed: “it was a crime. and it wasn’t my fault.” but no one ever told him that. what’s the word? now, years later, stiles works as the rural projects specialist at the national sexual violence resource center (nsvrc). while he said there have been improvements in some areas — such as in the way victims/survivors are treated and the legal definitions of these crimes — the problems still persist. “it’s the connotations that go along with those terms that can become very problematic for individuals,” stiles said. the hunting ground’ team tells us why campus rapes are being covered up that’s why it’s important to pay attention to the language you’re using, laura palumbo, the prevention campaign specialist at nsvrc told mtv news in a recent interview. starting with the way we refer to people who have experienced sexual violence, there’s a certain amount of care that needs to be taken: “we have individuals who may not be ready to identify with the experience yet,” palumbo said, because they may still be working on re-framing or starting to understand what they went through. “we find that it’s going to be a different perspective from every victim and survivor. [when referring to them,] we’ll use ’victim’ or ’survivor,’ or use the terms together.” getty not every individual identifies their experience in the same way, and it’s important to keep that idea straight: there’s no one-size-fits-all term for a person who’s encountered trauma. one woman tells us what it’s like to be raped — and have your town turn against you and, for many of those individuals, the legal terms — meant to describe that trauma in a way the courts can make sense of — also fail. “i would have to say that the names don’t fit, and it bothers them,” stiles said. “even though this is what the law statute says, we know it’s a crime of sexual violence and it’s not [clear in the language.] that is kind of the easiest way for the criminal justice system to be sorting the crime and experience into these categories, and these terms are oftentimes very ambiguous. i think [it’s] one of the harder parts of legal terminology; it varies in every state.” what the laws (don’t) say in “missoula,” jon krakauer’s latest book chronicling sexual assaults in a college football town, krakauer gives several examples of times where “sexual intercourse without consent” is “the legal term for rape in montana.” stiles said that he’s sure the state’s lawmakers were trying to create these terms with the best of intentions, but the failures of the legal language show a need for education on the subject and collaboration with victim/survivor’s advocates. is this amy schumer skit the most perfect rape culture satire ever? “they may have been trying to describe [the crimes],” stiles said. “but, they’re a little bit removed.” he said that while it’s clear they tried to bring in the idea of consent, and demonstrate that a sexual act without consent is a crime, there’s still something unsettlingly sanitized and innocuous about the use of the word “intercourse.” getty there are a lot of problems with using the word ’intercourse,’ palumbo said. first: it’s also not inclusive enough to encompass the kinds of violation that do not necessarily involve intercourse. and, it’s misleading: it conjures the images of sex — something consensual, probably between heterosexuals —  which takes a lot of the emotion and diversity out of the crime. “they are all patchwork terms made in the legal system that are shifting and evolving into a different way of talking about sexual violence,” he said. jon krakauer’s book on acquaintance rape looks to repair rolling stone damage that evolution, as claire gordon at al jazeera america reported in 2014, is a kind of “rebranding.” brett sokolow, the ceo of the national center for higher education risk management, a consulting and law firm, told al jazeera that he originated the terms “nonconsensual sexual intercourse” and “nonconsensual sexual contact” as a way of bypassing many universities’ inability to believe that their students could be guilty of rape. “it was a word that meant rape but without rape’s stigma,” gordon wrote. it was a nicer way of getting officials to talk about an ugly truth. sokolow later told al jazeera that “in an ideal world, we should call [rape] what it is.” sokolow explained, “to water down the language a little bit, to get more hearing panels to hold these guys accountable, i think it’s worth the trade-off.” in 2006, a judge in nebraska ruled that the words “rape,” “sexual assault,” “victim,” “assailant,” and “sexual assault kit” couldn’t be used in the trial of pamir safi, who was accused of raping tory bowen in october of 2004, according to slate. getty instead, bowen was required to describe her assault using the word “sex.” and, to many advocates, that kind of “water[ing] down” is extremely dangerous. these high school students are talking about slut shaming and rape culture in a whole new way but, what does it mean when the word “rape” is seen as a word too horrible to apply to even the most horrible of crimes? palumbo says it fails everyone. “when the language isn’t clear and representative, it discounts the experience for an individual and it kind of confirms something for people who are desensitized to the needs of victims and survivors of sexual violence,” palumbo said. she adds that it helps create conditions in our society that allow for 1 in 5 women and 1 in 17 men to be the victims of sexual assault in their lifetimes, where victims do not report their assaults for fear of being blamed by the public or doubted by the police. “when our terminology fails to convey the gravity of sexual violence and its impact on an individual’s life,” palumbo said, “it really re-enforces all those misconceptions and all of these myths around what sexual assault looks like and what it means to be a person who causes sexual harm.” for more on rape culture, visit lookdifferent.org your daily dose of the latest news get the mtv news app today. katherine speller view related posts around the web powered by zergnet zergnet news about archive faq/help jobs terms of use privacy policy/privacy rights copyright closed captioning eventful partners ad choices ©2016 viacom international inc. all rights reserved. mtv and all related titles and logos are trademarks of viacom international inc.
http://www.mtv.com:80/news/2166137/schools-referring-kids-to-police/	when black students are arrested for throwing skittles, the punishment rarely fits the crime - mtv			 mtv menu mtv mtv home tv provider signout news news music getty issues for black students, the punishment rarely fits the crime black students make up 16% of total student enrollment in the u.s., but represent 31% of students arrested in school. by katherine speller 6/3/2015 back in january, a 15-year-old african-american student was taking a test in his third-period social studies class when a police officer walked in and told him he was under arrest. as the officer handcuffed him, he reportedly twisted the teen’s arm hard enough to make him scream. that only made things worse: the school guard soon threatened to tack on a charge of resisting arrest. with the principal and classmates looking on, the officer led the student out of the school, while allegedly saying things like “i’ve got you now,” and threatening to “beat the f–k out of” him. by now you have to be wondering what this kid’s crime was, right? well, he threw skittles on the school bus the day before. jefferson parish public school system/facebook yes, flinging a bag of skittles is an offense that can be charged as “simple battery” if you happen to go to school in louisiana’s jefferson parish school system — the largest district in the state — and this student’s story is just one uncovered in the southern poverty law center’s recent complaint against jpss. why did teens in baltimore riot? the answer begins long before freddie gray there’s a real problem in jefferson parish, and it points to a larger national issue: students are being arrested for things that aren’t actually crimes — just broken school rules. it’s happening disproportionately more often to students of color and, as mtv news found out, the consequences can be lasting and dire. from the school bus to the detention center the student who threw skittles at a classmate spent the next six days, scared, in a rivarde detention center (a local juvenile facility) before appearing in court. his mother was only informed of the incident when he arrived at the center. the problem with charges like “simple battery,” according to jessica feierman, supervising attorney at the juvenile law center, is that they’re really, really broad. they can easily be applied to any typical rowdy teenage behaviors (like horseplay, yelling, cursing, or even throwing candy). “the definition of battery is ’an intentional act causing harmful or unwanted touching,'” feierman explained to mtv news. “using the broadest arguments, you can make that claim that the skittles thrown at a kid is ’simple battery.” getty “once those broad laws are on the books, they leave so much discretion [to the police], and there are so many police in the schools, who aren’t being given guidance in a meaningful way,” feierman said. and the advocates at the southern poverty law center (splc) agree that’s the case in jefferson parish, where those conditions have vastly increased the likelihood of unnecessary arrests. the color of your skin most definitely plays a role as for why students of color are affected more often, stephen phillippi, director at the institute of public health and justice at louisiana state university, said bias most definitely plays a role. virginia’s governor calls for an investigation into martese johnson’s arrest “it’s a natural question i don’t think we’ve done well to answer, but there’s an inherent bias,” phillippi said. “regardless [of an individual’s race], there is an inclination toward seeing african-americans as more aggressive for some reason in american systems.” that bias can lead teachers and police officers to treat black and white students misbehaving completely differently; over-policing students of color lands them in handcuffs, while their white classmates end up in after-school detention or a parent-teacher conference. to find out more about racial bias visit lookdifferent.org this happens in jefferson parish, and it happens across the country. but this isn’t the first complaint for jefferson parish the splc sent a complaint, just like the one detailed above, back in 2012. it told the stories of four different students of color arrested at school on charges that weren’t really criminal, sara godchaux, staff attorney at the splc said. the center launched an investigation with the department of education, but nothing ever really came of it. the arrests kept happening. the county even looked into this issue years before that when they partnered with models for change, an organization that worked in multiple states to reform the juvenile justice system. in 2007, jefferson parish received $350,000 from the macarthur foundation, which allowed them to bring in models for change to take a closer look at the way the courts handled juvenile cases. one of the strategies the organization tried to implement was to get nearly all referrals that were non-violent or misdemeanor charges to go through community programs or support services instead of the courts. is it safe to film police officers, like the one who killed walter scott? when kids get arrested for breaking school rules, said phillippi, who worked on the project in 2007, it’s supposed to be after the school has “exhausted” all other disciplinary options. the school first needs to try after-school detention sessions, out-of-school suspensions, meetings with parents and teachers, and meetings with school resource counselors — an arrest should be the last resort. according to phillippi, the courts have been more and more critical of referrals that don’t prove schools tried all of these other options first. the splc also states that the majority of “non-violent, misdemeanor school-based arrests” are very quickly dismissed, refused and diverted by judges. does the skittles case prove not much has changed in jefferson parish? referrals to the courts have declined in jefferson parish, according to models for change, particularly for “less serious behavior,” including charges of simple battery, disturbing the peace, or interference with an education facility. they report that the referrals on these charges decreased by 58% from 518 in the 2007–2008 school year to 216 in 2011–2012. they also say that the school resource officers at jpss requested and received training to better respond to youth with behavioral problems and mental illness. the models for change findings only go up to the 2012-2013 school year. and the splc, however, doesn’t believe the problem has really been addressed, since kids are still being referred to the police in high numbers across the school system. in their complaint, splc reported that the jefferson parish school system still had the highest number of students with school-based arrests and referrals in the state during the 2011-2012 school year: with 706 students arrested and 923 referred. this map of police violence aims to create a path to justice that may not seem so bad considering they’re the largest district in the state with 45,914 students, but it looks a lot worse when stacked against the next largest district — east baton rouge parish with 42,985 students — where only 170 students were referred to law enforcement and 0 students were arrested in school. the splc also reports that jpss continues to refer more students of color than white students to the police under the broad charges of simple battery and interference with an educational facility. in response to mtv news’ request for an interview, jefferson parish school district released this statement: “we are aware of and are very concerned by these allegations. we pledge to work closely with those agencies involved to quickly resolve any issues that we identify. we are committed to ensuring that our students have a safe, healthy environment and are treated equably at all schools.” forget ’scared straight,’ arrests can mean the end of your education when the skittles case eventually hit the courtroom, the judge reportedly said what we were thinking all along: “are we really here about skittles?” but, the eighth-grader — like so many other kids who were arrested for minor offenses — is still struggling in the aftermath, sara godchaux, staff attorney at the splc, said. while he used to be outgoing and into sports, he quickly started to withdraw from the things he once loved. getty “the kids who are arrested, they’re embarrassed,” godchaux told mtv news. “being pulled out of class by the police is very humiliating. they just don’t want to be at school anymore: they don’t trust their teachers, the administrators or the police officers on campus or in their communities.” more often than not, kids who have their first brush with the law earlier in life have a harder time — socially, emotionally and academically — regardless of how it pans out in the court, feierman said. even if they end up dismissed later on in the courts, the damage is already done. it’s really common for kids to fall behind on their work once introduced into the justice system, she said, and it’s often impossible to catch up once class time is missed. and too many of them don’t make it to graduation. “it’s a really big issue; about two-thirds of these students drop out of school,” feierman said. “the reality is that for a lot of young people who are arrested, that’s the end of their education and their life goes in a really different direction.” why ’restorative justice’ matters she said that one goal for people looking to improve the juvenile justice system is pretty obvious: keep kids in school. feierman explained that it’s important to support programs that prioritize the education and rehabilitation of kids in the system — they turn “mistakes” into “teaching moments” — and aim to ensure they never end up in the adult criminal justice system. 13 seriously f--ked up things about women and girls in prison feierman is a big fan of second chances. “[the juvenile justice system] is supposed to be about helping young people become happy and healthy adults, so they have the chance to get on the right track and overcome any mistakes that they made,” she said. “all young people deserve a chance to be at school and have their education.” for more information on restorative justice, visit the juvenile law center at jlc.org your daily dose of the latest news get the mtv news app today. katherine speller view related posts around the web powered by zergnet zergnet news about archive faq/help jobs terms of use privacy policy/privacy rights copyright closed captioning eventful partners ad choices ©2016 viacom international inc. all rights reserved. mtv and all related titles and logos are trademarks of viacom international inc.
http://www.mtv.com:80/news/2223339/uplift-sexual-abuse-youtube/	here’s how your youtube faves are fighting sexual abuse online and irl - mtv			 mtv menu mtv mtv home tv provider signout news news music uplift issues here’s how your youtube faves are fighting sexual abuse online and irl on your screens and the scene, this group wants to make online communities safer. by katherine speller 7/27/2015 last march, it sort of felt like everything was falling apart in the youtube fandom. more than 70 different accounts were published (an overwhelming amount from underage or teenaged girls) throughout the web detailing sexually manipulative, abusive behaviors and even cases of sexual assault by prominent youtube-famous personalities. it was a time when a lot of the people in that community felt unsafe and heartbroken over their idols letting them down, but also a time when users wanted to take action and make some real changes. that’s how uplift: online communities against sexual violence first got started — as a task force to respond to the surge of disclosures and assess the community’s needs. embedded from www.youtube.com. </noscript></div> in a matter of days, the women behind uplift — sahitya raja, katie twyman and grace miller — had sent over a proposal to john and hank green of the vlogbrothers, two leaders in the online video community, and started connecting with other influential youtubers. soon after, they developed the idea for a series of videos and a community-wide pledge that would foster a dialogue between creators, fans and everyone in-between. within a year, they became a full-fledged non-profit. they teamed up with kat lazo (theekatsmeoww on youtube) and kelly kend to produce videos that would help engage members of the community in those oh-so-important conversations. as host, lazo gently guides viewers through the scary and confusing process of coming to terms with or identifying an assault or abusive situation and what their options and resources are. she offers consistent reassurance that nothing is their fault and that there are people who care and want to help. it’s like you’re sitting in the bedroom of a wise older sister, getting some much-needed advice, but it never feels like you’re being lectured. uplift while they are the first to say they are not counselors or trained advocates, the members of uplift want to show that certain behaviors just won’t be tolerated in online communities (whether it’s youtube, tumblr, vine, etc.) and make sure victims and survivors know that they are not alone, that they have resources and options, and that they can remain part of the communities and fandoms they love. “we wanted to make sure [uplift] was about comfort, support and the passion of the community,” jennifer dorsey, communications director of uplift told mtv news. “we created our program for people to take ownership back of their communities, making sure they feel like they belong to them.” standing up and speaking out irl uplift manned a table at vidcon this year, offering up a full-sized poster of their safer community pledge for attendees to read and sign (they’d filled 3 posters since we last talked.) but that wasn’t the only symbol of their mission at the convention: on each of the attendees’ badges, there was a clearly written code of conduct that let everyone know the kind of behavior that was expected of them, and listed a number for a hotline they could use to report anything that made them uncomfortable. uplift “for con attendees to see that actual physical presence really means something,” raja said. what was once pretty undefined and dangerous about internet convention etiquette was spelled out in the open. shady situations that were once only whispered about were clearly and openly condemned by the community and event organizers. “something that we’ve been prioritizing is coming up with resources that detail exactly that,” grace miller, operations director and co-founder, added. “because these kinds of communities are so new, everyone is collaborating together to create these new social norms.” this is where the law messes up when talking about sexual assault. how to change the culture a large demographic in the youtube community is young women, aged roughly 13 to 17. most of the women who shared stories of manipulation, coercion or assault belonged to that demographic and experienced those behaviors with older, male youtubers who were well-known and loved in the community. tldr; they had all the power. “i just want to convey that this community is made up of individuals,” sahitya raja, co-executive director and co-founder told mtv news. “we’re talking about an overall culture that can be changed by individuals. the more people talking about this, the more change.” for uplift, that change starts with better understanding of the relationship between the creators and fans. while it may seem like “youtube famous” people are more accessible — they interact closely on social media and seem so familiar in their videos — they are still celebrities, raja said. via uplift “it may seem like you get to know every inside detail of their lives, but these are celebrities that hold social power,” raja said. that power, even if it doesn’t seem like such a big deal, can cause an imbalance that makes gaining consent more difficult. that’s one of the reasons uplift is also working with people on the other side of the camera: to determine how to pay better attention to these power dynamics, and really change the relationship between creators and fans for the better. “it’s not the responsibility of the person with less social power to make sure they’re safe, it’s the responsibility of those in power,” miller said. for more information on rape culture and sexual assault resources, visit look different. your daily dose of the latest news get the mtv news app today. katherine speller view related posts around the web powered by zergnet zergnet news about archive faq/help jobs terms of use privacy policy/privacy rights copyright closed captioning eventful partners ad choices ©2016 viacom international inc. all rights reserved. mtv and all related titles and logos are trademarks of viacom international inc.

asia, europe, and the united states is highlighted through this digitally illustrated lecture program. spanning over 2,000 years, the collections include masterpieces of painting, sculpture, prints, and drawings displayed with a wide range of furniture, silver, glasswork, architectural elements, and entire furnished period rooms from historic houses. 20th century painting and sculpture available year-round the museum’s superb collection of modern and contemporary art is among the most distinguished in the world. highlights include an extraordinary concentration of work by artistic giants such as pablo picasso, marcel duchamp, and henri matisse, as well as american modernists like georgia o’keeffe. the expanding contemporary collections include major works by jasper johns and sol lewitt, along with younger artists who are breaking new ground today. the american collection available year-round the history of the united states is brought to life through the museum’s american collections, which survey three centuries of paintings, furniture, sculpture, and decorative arts with a special emphasis on philadelphia’s rich traditions. the collections include important portraits, landscapes, and figure paintings by eighteenth and nineteenth-century masters, including the country’s finest group of work by philadelphia’s thomas eakins. an eakins masterpiece restored: seeing the gross clinic anew available year-round acquired by the philadelphia museum of art and the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts in 2007 after a stirring public campaign to keep the painting in philadelphia, thomas eakins’ masterpiece, portrait of dr. samuel d. gross (the gross clinic) of 1875, has been cleaned and restored for the first time in almost fifty years. the painting emerges from the conservation studio as the centerpiece of this exhibition, which throws new light on a work acclaimed as the greatest american painting of the nineteenth century. inviting visitors to see this celebrated painting afresh, the exhibition first evokes the experience of the gross clinic in eakins’s own day. aiming to make an international impression at the centennial exhibition, which took place in philadelphia in 1876, the young and ambitious eakins (1844–1916) prepared a monumental modern history painting celebrating the nation’s most famous surgeon, dr. samuel gross of jefferson medical college (now part of thomas jefferson university). rejected by the jury as too gruesome for the art galleries, however, the picture was installed among the medical displays of the u. s. army model post hospital. eakins’s preparatory studies for the painting, x-radiographs of the canvas, historical images of the gross clinic, and a video documentary help visitors understand how the painting was made, how it looked in 1875, and how and why it has changed over time. park house guide outreaches fairmount park houses available year-round this digitally illustrated lecture on the historic fairmount park houses offers unique glimpses into early philadelphia. through these brilliantly preserved mansions, observe architectural and decorative styles of the day and learn more about the lives of prominent philadelphians in colonial times. the lecture includes mount pleasant, cedar grove, woodford mansion, lemon hill, sweetbriar, strawberry mansion, and laurel hill. the perelman building available year-round with its gleaming rows of windows, bright interior, and twin cathedral-like entrances, the landmark art deco building on fairmount and pennsylvania avenues was called "the gateway to fairmount park" when it opened in 1927 as the headquarters for the fidelity mutual life insurance company. it has now been dramatically recast in a new role as the gateway to the future for the philadelphia museum of art. set within a lively urban neighborhood, commanding a spectacular view of fairmount park, and just across the street from the museum's main building, the new galleries and study centers showcase some of the museum's most comprehensive, colorful, and cutting-edge collections. the waterworks available year-round philadelphia was the first city in the colonies to regard the consistent delivery of safe drinking water to its citizens as a municipal responsibility. it named a watering committee in the late 1700’s which eventually had the water works built on the eastern banks of the schuylkill river. learn about the history of the water works - its many lives (including how the art museum came to be built on top of the old reservoir), its almost demise, and its revitalization. sponsors accessible programs at the philadelphia museum of art are generously supported by the women’s committee of the philadelphia museum of art, the philadelphia

basket of fruit (1864) by édouard manet; railroad to dieppe (1886) and avenue de l’opéra: morning sunshine (1898), both by camille pissarro; and young girl with basket (1892) by berthe morisot. in addition, two rare early portraits by marcel duchamp have been received from yolande candel, daughter of duchamp’s lifelong friend gustave candel. they depict her grandparents and were painted in paris in 1911–12. these works, currently on view in the galleries, add greater depth to areas of the collection that are already very strong. the museum has extensive holdings of the works of cézanne and houses the world’s largest collection of works by duchamp. learn more >> the keith l. and katherine sachs collection of contemporary art the museum has recently acquired one of the country's leading private collections of contemporary art, formed by keith l. and katherine sachs. the sachs collection, a promised gift of nearly one hundred works from the 1950s to the present, is exceptional for its concentration of art by american masters jasper johns and ellsworth kelly. it also reflects a strong focus on major british and german artists such as richard hamilton and joseph beuys, important outdoor sculpture including those by richard serra and tony smith, large-scale photography by artists such as jeff wall and andreas gursky, and video art by celebrated figures bill viola and steve mcqueen, among others. closely associated with the museum for decades, keith (a trustee since 1988) and katherine sachs have been collecting art with great dedication for more than forty years. to celebrate this transformative gift and the couples exceptional generosity, the museum has named its renowned modern and contemporary art galleries the keith l. and katherine sachs galleries. the museum will present a full-scale exhibition devoted to the sachs collection, and an accompanying scholarly catalogue, in the summer of 2016. learn more >> the paul strand collection the philadelphia museum of art has acquired, through several gifts and a purchase agreement with the aperture foundation, the core collection of photographs by paul strand, one of the preeminent photographers of the twentieth century. as a whole, this acquisition comprises more than 3,000 prints and lantern slides, including the finest examples of every image in the archive. joining the more than six hundred strand photographs already in the museum's collections, this acquisition makes the philadelphia museum of art the world's most important repository for the study of his work. portrait of yarrow mamout (muhammad yaro) gallery 101, american art, first floor yarrow mamout, an african american muslim who won his freedom from slavery, was reputedly 140 years old in 1819, when charles willson peale painted this portrait for display in his philadelphia museum. although peale learned this was a miscalculation, the story of eighty-three-year-old yarrow (c. 1736–1823), a native of the west african country of guinea who was literate in arabic, was still remarkable. as peale noted, yarrow was “comfortable in his situation having bank stock and [he] lives in his own house.” a rare representation of ethnic and religious diversity in early america, and an outstanding example of peale’s late naturalistic style, the picture is distinguished by the direct and sympathetic encounter between the artist and his subject and the skilled rendering of the details of physiognomy and age. yarrow’s knit cap suggests a kufi, a hat traditionally worn by african muslim men to assert their religion or african identity, but peale artfully employs its yellow band to highlight his steady gaze with its glint of humor and wisdom. seventy-seven years old when he created this portrait, peale was seeking a record of the personal traits that he believed supported a long life. in his writings and museum displays peale celebrated making wise choices to maintain good health and a positive attitude, and he perceived yarrow’s perseverance through his difficult life as a model of resourcefulness, industriousness, sobriety, and an unwillingness to become dispirited. 255e home collections   search collections new acquisitions explore collections audio tours art 24/7   support art 24/7   purchase admission online         © 2016 philadelphia museum of art search | sitemap | privacy & security | contacts © 2016 philadelphia museum of art search | sitemap | privacy & security | contacts 20

collectors artists and makers the exceptional breadth and depth of the museum’s holdings are due in large part to the generosity of its donors and their commitment to this institution and its visitors. here are a few figures whose contributions have enriched the collection. jill and sheldon bonovitz for the last three decades, jill and sheldon bonovitz have assembled one of the finest private holdings of american “outsider art,” or work by self-taught artists. in 2011 they made a promised gift to the museum of nearly two hundred works from their impressive collection, which features celebrated artists martín ramírez, james castle, and bill traylor as well as relatively little-known figures such as jon serl and simon sparrow. this transformative gift launched the museum into the top ranks of us institutions that pursue this inventive, sometimes idiosyncratic material. it is a splendid contribution to the institution’s distinguished holdings of modern and contemporary art. in addition to outsider art, jill and sheldon bonovitz have presented fine examples of kanthas and phulkaris, lively embroidered textiles from bengal and the punjab region of india and pakistan as gifts and promised gifts to the museum. explore the jill and sheldon bonovitz collection >> carl otto kretzschmar von kienbusch the core of the museum’s holdings of arms and armor was acquired in 1977 with the bequest from new york businessman carl otto kretzschmar von kienbusch of his private collection, long regarded as the finest in existence. assembled from about 1914 to his death, the kienbusch collection comprises approximately 1,200 objects, primarily of european origin and dating from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century, for use in battles, ceremonies, tournaments, or hunting. it features complete armors, equestrian equipment, helmets and other armor elements, and weapons. most objects in the kienbusch collection can be traced to the ancestral armories of european rulers and noblemen, or the arsenals of provinces and municipalities; and to the private collections of prominent nineteenth- and twentieth-century american and european collectors. at the heart of kienbusch’s collecting endeavors was his intent to assemble a representative selection of some of the best expressions of armor as an art form. explore the carl otto kretzschmar von kienbusch collection >> alfred and margaret caspary the strength of the museum’s collection of chinese art, particularly in ceramics, is due in part to a remarkable gift from alfred and margaret caspary. a successful new york stockbroker and a renowned stamp collector, caspary followed a unique path to collecting chinese art. his interest in chinese ceramics may have grown from his acquaintance with john d. rockefeller jr, then a leading collector of chinese porcelains. in 1939 caspary purchased more than 400 chinese porcelains, primarily made during the reign of the kangxi emperor (1662–1722), from the estate of glasgow shipping magnate leonard gow. the collection—including a striking vase formerly in the treasury of augustus the strong of saxony—was put into storage, where it remained until caspary’s death in 1955, when it was given to the museum. asked why he had purchased the porcelains, caspary explained that while he could make more money, he could not guarantee an opportunity such as the sale of gow’s collection would present itself again—a happy circumstance from which the museum and its visitors have benefited greatly. explore the alfred and margaret caspary collection >> a. e. gallatin donated to the museum in 1952, albert e. gallatin’s gift helped build the foundation of what is one of the most important collections of modern art in the world. in the 1920s gallatin was a frequent visitor to the paris studios of georges braque, fernand léger, and pablo picasso. one of only a handful of american collectors of vanguard european art, gallatin opened his gallery of living art at new york university in 1927. announced as the first public collection devoted to contemporary art, it was a beacon for american artists, including jackson pollock and philip guston. highlights of gallatin’s collection include fernand léger’s the city and picasso’s three musicians and glass of absinthe, one of the artist’s extraordinarily rare early sculptures. when nyu terminated its lease of gallatin’s gallery space in 1942, museum director fiske kimball persuaded him to loan his works to philadelphia. the more than 160 objects later entered the museum’s collection after gallatin’s death in 1952. explore the a. e. gallatin collection >> louise and walter arensberg louise and walter arensberg’s extraordinary gift to the museum in 1950, together with that of a. e. gallatin, forms the cornerstone of the institution’s modern art collection. their path to becoming collectors was set in 1913 after a visit to the legendary armory show in new york, where they encountered marcel duchamp’s nude descending a staircase (no. 2), a painting they would later acquire. in 1915 they eagerly opened their home to duchamp, inaugurating a forty-year friendship and collaboration between the artist and the collectors. throughout their collecting career, the arensbergs purchased works by henri matisse, pablo picasso, georges braque, salvador dalí, marc chagall, and vasily kandinsky, among others, and assembled the largest collection of constantin brancusi’s sculpture outside paris. their interests extended beyond western art, and their holdings of pre-columbian art were displayed alongside contemporary works. above all, the couple amassed the foremost collection of duchamp’s work in the world, making the museum a place of pilgrimage for generations of artists and art lovers. explore the louise and walter arensberg collection >> stella kramrisch stella kramrisch was the museum’s longtime curator of indian art and among the twentieth century’s most significant historians of the art and architecture of the indian subcontinent. she came to philadelphia in 1950, soon after her personal collection of eighth- to twelfth-century indian temple sculpture went on display at the museum. this collection, which the museum acquired in 1956, remains the most significant of its type, for both its historical importance and its quality, in any american museum. as a curator, kramrisch made many major acquisitions as well as created special exhibitions that introduced entire realms of indian art to the american public. on her death, she left more than seven hundred objects to the museum, including spectacular paintings and sculptures from india, tibet, nepal, and bangladesh. through her transformative gifts and acquisitions, and through her rich scholarship, she opened new spheres of art to the museum’s visitors and to the world. explore the stella kramrisch collection >> susan macdowell eakins susan macdowell eakins, 1900s, by thomas eakins. courtesy of bryn mawr college art and artifact collections a large body of works by thomas eakins was donated in 1929 and 1930 by his widow, susan macdowell eakins, and their friend mary a. williams. philadelphia’s greatest artist, thomas eakins spent his lifetime painting the people and landscapes of his native city. sometimes unsparing and occasionally shocking, as in his monumental portrait of dr. samuel d. gross, eakins’s paintings of modern american life earned a reputation for blunt realism and psychological insight. although his career was marred by scandal, mostly related to his use of nude models and his own obstinate behavior, eakins lived to see his work hailed as definitively american. after the artist’s death, susan macdowell eakins began conversations with museum director fiske kimball to create a memorial gallery in the institution’s new building on fairmount. her and williams’s many gifts to the museum established the most important collection of thomas eakins’s paintings, drawings, sculptures, and photographs in the world. explore the thomas eakins collection >> john g. johnson esteemed lawyer john g. johnson bequeathed his extraordinary collection of nearly 1,200 paintings to the city of philadelphia upon his death in 1917. in 1933 the museum was asked to take responsibility for its care and display. renowned for its holdings of old master pictures by artists such as antonello da messina, sandro botticelli, pietro lorenzetti, and pinturicchio, the johnson collection also features major examples by nineteenth-century french artists gustave courbet, camille pissarro, pierre puvis de chavannes, and édouard manet. dutch art, primarily of the golden age, is also well represented, including works by rembrandt, pieter jansz. saenredam, jan steen, and jacob issacksz. van ruisdael. johnson’s interest in early netherlandish art led him to, arguably, his greatest gathering of masterpieces, such as robert campin’s exquisite christ and the virgin, jan van eyck’s meticulous saint francis of assisi receiving the stigmata, and rogier van der weyden’s moving crucifixion, with the virgin and saint john the evangelist mourning. explore the john g. johnson collection >> home collections   search collections new acquisitions explore collections audio tours art 24/7   support art 24/7   purchase

october 1, 2008 – september 30, 2011 mount pleasant: discovery of 18th-century painted wood graining in 2011, the museum’s furniture and woodwork conservators made an exciting discovery at mount pleasant. their research revealed that the original finish on the wainscot and wood trim in the first floor stair hall was wood graining. conservation of three historic firearms in the museum’s collections the examination and conservation treatment of a group of important handheld firearms was recently made possible with generous funding from the samuel h. kress foundation. twenty firearms dating from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries were carefully disassembled, and both internal and external components were examined for condition problems. a small group received conservation treatment, with the remaining firearms to be treated in the future. in proportion to the trouble - considering mount pleasant the following pages will provide an on-line resource for information about the recent investigation and examination of the surviving buildings, current and past conservation projects as well the varied and layered historical narratives of those associated with the history of mount pleasant. thomas eakins's the gross clinic the conservation of the gross clinic, frequently described as the most important american painting of the nineteenth century, can only be described as thrilling and daunting. what were the artist’s intentions? can we really recover the appearance of the painting when it was new? should we even try? or should we accept the changes in a painting over time as part of the history of the object? medici chest the following is a summary of the collaborative research by the museum’s scientific, conservation and curatorial staff as presented in the paper, figdor and the medici: notes on the collection and display of italian renaissance furniture at the philadelphia museum of art to 1930, including a technical study of a fifteenth-century painted chest’, furniture history vol. xlv (2009) costume & textiles department move in january 2008, the first of over 30,000 objects from the costume and textiles conservation department moved through the doors of the new storage facility in the ruth and raymond g. perelman building. finishing techniques in metalwork works of art made of metal are decorated through a variety of methods, which are referred to as finishing techniques. these techniques can be classified into two major categories: chemical or physical. this publication describes several finishing methods along with a brief history of their use. french empire mantel clock this important clock from the museum's collection required treatment to return its disfigured surfaces to their bright original appearance. saving a colonial masterpiece: mount pleasant restored mount pleasant survives as one of the greatest american houses of the eighteenth century, a testament to the skill and ambition of colonial builders and clients. remarkably, the estate remains largely intact on its original site as an ensemble of buildings within a landscape that offers the parklike view and river prospect first enjoyed by its original owners. conservation of a tibetan altar the goals of this project were to reveal the brilliant colors and artistry beneath the accumulated soot of a tibetan altar, as well as reconstruct the altar, create a structural support, and explore both the altar's age and the artisans’ materials and techniques. technical study of a painting: luca signorelli’s head of a boy long thought to be a fragment cut from a larger work, examination has shown that this painting was in fact originally made on a small, hastily prepared scrap of wood. conservation treatment of the ormerod bedcover one of the museum's most significant printed textiles, a bedcover printed by george ormerod, was extremely fragile and arrived at the museum with numerous losses. preventative conservation activities a fundamental responsibility of the museum is the prevention of deterioration of art and artifacts through control of the environment in storage and exhibition. preventive conservation entails storing, displaying, handling and maintaining a museum's collections in ways that promote long term stability and do not lead to deterioration. drawing materials from old master prints and drawings to large-scale contemporary works that incorporate elements of collage or photographic techniques, works of art on paper encompass prints, drawings and photographs in seemingly unlimited variety. thomas eakins: paintings and photography a sharp eye on nature, (2001), is a half-hour documentary presenting conservators’ exciting discovery of 19th-century american artist thomas eakins’s use of projected photographs in making paintings. east asian art storage project this multiphase effort has provided a safe and effective storage area for the museum’s east asian art collection. the project involved rehousing approximately 4,000 objects. conservation of rodin's the thinker after being displayed outdoors in an urban-industrial environment for over 60 years, philadelphia’s version of rodin’s the thinker showed the effects of "acid rain" and particulate deposition common in such atmospheres. home research   conservation publications provenance costume & textiles study room prints, drawings, & photographs study room center for american art korean heritage group archives library and digital collections   support conservation   purchase admission online         © 2016 philadelphia museum of art search | sitemap | privacy & security | contacts © 2016 philadelphia museum of art search | sitemap | privacy & security | contacts 20

how do shapes fit together to create new shapes and form patterns? what are some different ways of creating designs? all aboard! railroad transportation - locomotive briar cliff social studies - historical & cultural contexts in this lesson plan, we will be learning about railroad transportation by taking a closer look at locomotive briar cliff, a painting made around 1860 by w. l. bresse, and connecting it with learning experiences to explore how a train works and transports people and materials. an exercise in reverie: finding meaning in art language arts - aesthetic response according to philosopher john armstrong, “reverie is the state of giving ourselves up to the flow of associations. this state of letting something happen—a species of relaxation—is one we need to cultivate when we look at paintings or buildings. . . . reverie is a mode of introducing personal material into a picture or building: it brings an abundance of thoughts and feelings into play. it also frees us from merely following routine assumptions. . . . reverie operates at the root of thinking: it is essential to the creative process in which we come to make thoughts for ourselves.” in this lesson, students are encouraged to contemplate art and make associations to prior experiences and memories in order to construct meaning that is both personal and original. through writing, students record their ideas and understandings to be shared with others. art and the golden rectangle mathematics - aesthetic response the golden rectangle is a geometric concept found in many aspects of the natural world as well as in architecture, art, and popular culture. this lesson is designed to be part of a geometry curriculum discussing the mathematical and aesthetic qualities of basic shapes, and of their use in society and nature. artful thinking: beginning/middle/end and perceive/know/care about language arts - critical response the artful thinking approach, designed by project zero at harvard university, teaches students how to think critically through the use of simple routines that guide them to develop processes for observing and analyzing art. the art is a force for developing thinking skills and thinking dispositions that students can then apply across the curriculum. artful thinking: step inside and ten times two language arts - aesthetic response the artful thinking approach, designed by project zero at harvard university, teaches students how to think critically through the use of simple routines for observing and analyzing art. in doing so, the visual arts becomes a force for developing thinking skills and dispositions that students can apply across the curriculum. artful thinking: the elaboration game language arts - aesthetic response the elaboration game encourages students to look deeply at a work of art. the goal is to facilitate careful observation and the ability to communicate effectively what is observed. after close observation provides a depth of information and insights, interpretation of what the student has seen is enhanced. students will be asked to work in small groups to observe and then to build on those observations. assessment can be through extended discussion or through writing. artful thinking: what makes you say that? language arts - aesthetic response the thinking routine called “what makes you say that?” is designed to encourage deep observation, followed by an explanation of support that is the basis of critical thinking. building explanations for observations promotes evidence-based reasoning. further, listening to the reasoning offered by classmates allows students to understand alternatives and multiple perspectives associated with 21st century learning skills. this lesson also scaffolds to a more sophisticated version of the strategy, asking students to make a claim from their observations, support that claim, and develop further questions from their preliminary work. brainstorming to connect thinking skills with abstract art language arts - critical response this lesson, although aligned with career, art, and twenty-first century standards, can be easily adapted for any core subject area. common core math and islamic art mathematics - historical & cultural contexts one of the skills highlighted in the common core state standards for mathematics involves generating and analyzing patterns and pattern relationships. islamic art made for a religious purpose or setting does not include images of people, and often focuses on intricate geometric designs. a close look at islamic art provides an opportunity, not only for the reinforcement of these common core skills, but also for a glimpse inside this important culture. descriptive writing language arts - aesthetic response descriptive writing vividly portrays a person, place, or thing in such a way that the reader can visualize the topic and enter into the writer's experience. the best writing engages our five senses, and nothing provides as rich an opportunity for sensory engagement as art. this lesson is designed to help students recognize sensory details in works of art and incorporate these details into their writing. details, details: how choices reveal character, setting, tone, and theme. (analyzing and interpreting, making inferences) language arts - critical response while biographers and historians are guided by actual events, artists and writers can select those details that suit their purposes, specifically to develop character, tone, conflict, and theme. digging-deep elements of art language arts - aesthetic response the elements and principals of art and design, and how they are used, contribute mightily to the ultimate composition of a work of art—and that can mean the difference between a masterpiece and a messterpiece. do we control nature, or does nature control us? science - historical & cultural contexts in 1970, 20 million people celebrated the first earth day. at that time, only about a third of the nation’s streams were safe for fishing or swimming, and major cities across the u.s. were often hidden under clouds of smoke. since then, the successes and challenges represented by earth day have centered on one question: do we control nature, or does nature control us? ekphrasis: the meeting of poetry and art language arts - critical response in this lesson, students will work in the opposite direction and use their skills in poetry to examine and interpret works of art. exploring contrasting story elements through tapestry and poetry language arts - historical & cultural contexts the philadelphia museum of art’s constantine tapestries represent thirteen iconic scenes from the life of the roman emperor constantine (around 270–337 ce). each tapestry is filled with detail and drama, and offers an opportunity to witness the ability of art to tell a story. this lesson, designed for a language arts classroom, grades 4–8, uses a structured poem (the diamante) to examine contrasting story elements in narrative art. exploring our five senses through art (preschool) language arts - aesthetic response though we may not actually be able to feel or hear the objects and scenes depicted in a painting, artists often invite us to use a variety of our senses when we explore a work of art, encouraging us to imagine the textures, smells, and even tastes of what is depicted. image and text: the language of the comic book language arts - production, performance, & exhibition in recent years graphic novels have gained mainstream attention for their ability to tell rich, complex stories in a unique way. books like art spiegelman’s maus showcase the power of the medium to combine powerful dialogue with rich visual metaphors. comic books are a creative way to engage students in the art of storytelling, decision making, and critical thinking. in this activity, students will be introduced to the basic language of comic books. they will explore the way comic artists use the sequential art that combines text and images to tell a story. discussion and exercises will lead each student toward creating an original, three-panel comic strip. introducing sculpture: art you can walk around (usually) language arts - aesthetic response sculpture is an art form that, unlike painting, printmaking, and photography, exists in 3-dimensional space. most sculpture can be explored from all sides. this 3-dimensional aspect challenges the artist and offers a new set of opportunities for expression. this lesson is meant to introduce students to some of the more common forms of sculpture, as well as to a few of the terms used for description and discussion. is there a formula for people? (measurement and proportion) mathematics - aesthetic response over the centuries, many different formulae have been created to describe the proportions of the human figure. to prepare for this lesson, ask students to bring in full-length magazine photos of people. do people follow a "design pattern"? is there a formula that can describe a how a human should appear? is there art in nature? what is the nature of art? science - aesthetic response while universities, most k-12 schools, and probably most people see a logical division of knowledge into the arts and the sciences, does this separation allow us to better understand our world – or does it get in the way of understanding? this lesson, designed for use in a science classroom but with clear applications to the humanities, examines and challenges the sometimes artificial lines we have drawn between the arts and the sciences. learning from primary sources social studies - historical & cultural contexts in this lesson, students study and interpret primary sources, including both objects (a historical house and a miniature portrait) and documents (a 1767 tax assessment and an excerpt from a 1769 issue of the pennsylvania gazette). through these sources students examine the experience of enslaved people of african descent and ship captain and slave owner john macpherson (1726–1792) at mount pleasant in the colonial era. medical science on canvas – the gross clinic science - historical & cultural contexts in this lesson plan we will uncover medical history by comparing thomas eakins’s the gross clinic, begun in 1875—which shows dr. samuel gross, a surgeon at jefferson medical school, operating on a young boy suffering from osteomyelitis—with images of modern-day surgery. moving from an agricultural to an industrial world social studies - historical & cultural contexts the industrial revolution was not fought between armies and governments—although there were periods of violence. from the late 1700s through th e early 1900s, every aspect of day-to-day life in europe and the united states was affected by changes in industry, transportation, and manufacturing. people from this era were often shocked by what seemed to be constant changes in their lifestyles, influencing how they viewed the world around them. writers often reflected on these changes and artists frequently incorporated industrial influences into their creations. physics at the art museum: swords and the center of mass science - critical response the design of swords uses the concept of center of mass to create a functional weapon that protects the user.through this lesson, students will engage in an inquiry based science lesson using the physics in art app tolearn about and apply the concept of center of mass. by the end of the lesson, students will be able to explainand demonstrate the application of the concept of newton’s third law by completing the guided notes whileusing the physics in art app and experimenting with center of mass in a lab. physics at the art museum: torque and calder’s mobiles science - critical response in order to create his mobiles, alexander calder needed to use his understanding of torque and rotationalequilibrium. in this lesson, students will use the physics at the art museum app as a starting point to explorethese physics concepts—as well as build an understanding how they allowed calder to create his balancedmobiles. in addition, students will create a diagram of a mobile with three horizontal arms, and will explain whythe design will achieve rotational equilibrium. picturing america lesson 1 - the power of women: art with a social agenda social studies - historical & cultural contexts the power of women is a common theme in art, and this lesson examines that themeusing images from the national endowment for the humanities (neh) picturingamerica resource in addition to objects from the collection of the philadelphia museumof art. the works in this lesson also promote the social agenda of the artist. studentsexplore connections to social issues and learn how each artist uses details to revealinner strengths through their subjects. picturing america lesson 2 - the power of symbolism language arts - historical & cultural contexts world leaders are, and always have been, larger than life, and for thousands of years, governments and statespersons have been keenly aware of the power of symbols to express complex beliefs, values, and ideas. this lesson explores how artists employ symbols to speak of the greatness of america’s premier founding father, george washington. students will examine several depictions of our country’s first president, focusing on the artist’s use of symbol. picturing america lesson 3 - for the birds science - aesthetic response before the discovery channel and before national geographic magazine, there wasartist/illsutrator john james audubon. the lifework of audubon focused primarily onthe wildlife of north america, with a particular interest in ornithology, the study ofbirds. in his monumental volume birds of america, audubon seamlessly blended artand science. in each of his 435 illustrations, he depicted not only an animal’s physicalappearance and habitat, but also its spirit and character. in this lesson students willexplore two works featured in birds of america that capture the beauty and ferocity ofamerican wildlife. picturing america lesson 4 - exploring identity social studies - historical & cultural contexts a portrait can communicate volumes about the sitter’s identity beyond physicalappearance. through the careful organization of elements such as costuming, props,setting, and pose, artists reveal the depth and complexities of their subjects’personalities. this lesson develops an awareness of how individuals express theiridentity through their outward appearances, and guides students through the criticalthinking skills of deductive reasoning and forming conclusions. picturing america lesson 5 - franklin: the man, the myth, the legend social studies - historical & cultural contexts benjamin franklin has been regarded as one of thegreatest minds of his age. throughout his life,franklin enjoyed international acclaim for his ideas,inventions, and personality. in death, this famequickly rose to mythic proportions. this lessonchallenges students to examine the birth offranklin’s legend by comparing portraits andsculptures that were created both during his lifeand after his death. picturing america lesson 6 - african american journeys social studies - aesthetic response the african american experience is a complex story populated with heroes anddramatic journeys. this lesson explores three stories from history: the artisticcontributions of the potter david drake; the rich and interesting life of yarrowmamout; the heroism and bravery of the fifty-fourth regiment from massachusetts andtheir commander colonel robert gould shaw; and the individuals who participated inthe selma-to-montgomery march for voting rights in 1965. students will see howartistic works offer insights into the people and events of history. picturing america lesson 7 - seeing history through the eyes of the artist language arts - historical & cultural contexts historical periods or moments can be appreciated in many forms. a video clip or audiofile provides context, as does a well-documented historical text. works of art can alsoprovide a lens into the past, documenting events and issues of the time through theeyes of the artist who produced it. this lesson compares paintings that commemoratesimilar historical periods, allowing the student to note similarities and differencesthrough the eyes of the artist. picturing america lesson 8 - conflict: man versus nature language arts - critical response mankind’s struggle for dominance over nature is a universal theme that has resonatedwith people throughout history. whether linked to a specific belief system, geographicarea, or culture, views about this relationship are ever-changing, and have often beenaddressed by american artists. this lesson explores the complex relationship of man inthe natural world. students will discover those details in artistic composition that revealthe artist’s views and compel the viewer to consider greater truths. picturing america lesson 9 - the artist’s vision: abstraction and the american west social studies - historical & cultural contexts since the early days of the united states, american artists have depicted their nation’slandscape as an iconic motif. following westward expansion of the nineteenth century,artists, too, began to settle their gazes on the unexplored terrain of the americanwest. by the twentieth century, the emerging visual language of abstraction providednew ways for artists to depict the world around them. this lesson examines two keyworks of american western landscape and guides students through the process ofresponding to abstract art. podcasting: writing your way into art science - critical response a podcast is an audio program made available in digital format for download over the internet. this lesson plan instructs students to develop an audio tour telling a story about a work of art. writing and recording a podcast can help students become better writers because, unlike more traditional projects, they can hear the flow of their words and ideas. using technology to share their work engages students and encourages peer review. podcasting about art also builds many common core skills by challenging students to observe, inquire, infer, describe, conclude, revise, produce, and publish. reading art as informational text with common core language arts - historical & cultural contexts the adoption of common core standards in english language arts and literacy has highlighted those skills required to understand and work with informational texts. the visual arts are viewed as alternative informational texts; and when also considered as primary source objects, works of art present unique opportunities to work with common core skills. this lesson will focus specifically on determining central ideas, supporting inferences and analyses with textual details, and comparing sources for specific events. stepping into a painting language arts - aesthetic response artists often invite us into their paintings so that we might imagine ourselves stepping inside the picture frame and experiencing it firsthand. some painters take this invitation to another level by painting details with such precision that viewers are tricked into believing the objects, people, and setting are real. these highly realistic paintings, known as trompe l’oeil, provide an ideal opportunity for students to respond to art by assuming the roles and voices of the painted figures. symbols: communicating beyond language language arts - historical & cultural contexts symbols are all around us. they are a natural part of our language and of the objects of our culture. in fact, our ability to communicate would be limited without the use of symbols. a symbol is a person, place, or object that represents something beyond itself. symbols possess standard interpretations, which are generally accepted by a culture, and also personal interpretations, which vary from one person to the next. these interpretations allow us to use symbols to examine other cultures and other viewpoints. symmetry and balance in art and math mathematics - aesthetic response of the many connections between mathematics and art, none is stronger than the shared concept of symmetry. mathematicians find symmetry pleasing in geometry, physicists find it pleasing in the study of motion, poets appreciate it in the play of words, and artists employ it in the creation of beauty. teaching critical thinking through landscape language arts - critical response the shift to implementing common core standards in schools has placed new emphasis on helping students develop critical thinking skills. while the use and definition of these skills continues to evolve. the power of women: art with a social agenda social studies - aesthetic response the power of women is a common theme in art, and this lesson examines that theme using images from the national endowment for the humanities picturing america image set as well as from the philadelphia museum of art. each of the works in this lesson also promotes the social agenda of the artist. students will see connections to social issues, and will see how the artist/photographer uses details to reveal inner strengths. thinking about form and function in renaissance armor social studies - critical response armor is about protection – not to prevent the wearers from getting hit in battles or tournaments, but rather to let them take the hit – and survive. in addition to needing to be protective, armor also needed to let a knight move as freely as possible. this is as true about today’s armor, using composite materials and high-tech innovations, as it was true in the renaissance. this lesson entices students to think critically about the decisions that lie behind the construction of armor from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century armor, including 21st century critical thinking skills of making judgments and decisions and using systems thinking. thinking space the grid in art and math mathematics - production, performance, & exhibition both artists and mathematicians use grids to help them understand and manipulate space. spatial ability, which is the ability “to generate, retain, retrieve, and transform well-structured visual images” in two and three dimensions is fundamental to both domains, and has been found to be a key indicator in the long-term academic and professional success of students. experiences of looking at and creating works of art may help develop this skill, and can significantly enhance student math achievement, as documented by the framing student success: connecting rigorous visual arts, math and literacy learning program that integrated and studied the effects of high-quality standards-based instruction in the visual arts, math, and literacy in three new york city public schools. this lesson asks students to use grids to think and create in two and three dimensions by looking, drawing, and making. thinking tools for innovators: part 1 – observing science - critical response recent research has shown that we can build innovative thinkers by reinforcing a set of thinking tools or skills, including such skills as observing, abstracting, pattern recognition, modeling, transforming (among others). thinking tools for innovators: part 2 – imagining mathematics - critical response this lesson plan is the second in a series that is focused on using art to enrich instruction in these critical skills. the research on which this information is based can be found in many sources, perhaps best summarized in the book sparks of genius: the thirteen thinking tools of the world's most creative people by robert and michele root-bernstein. thinking tools for innovators: part 3 – abstracting mathematics - critical response recent research has shown that we can build innovative thinkers by reinforcing a set of thinking tools, including such skills as observing, imagining, pattern recognition, modeling, and transforming. as these skills can be taught, it makes sense that we can help students become the creative thinkers that we will need in the twenty-first century. thinking tools for innovators: part 4 – recognizing patterns mathematics - critical response we constantly see patterns all around us, and our brains organize our experience of the world through the recognition of these patterns. consider something as basic as a joke: tell a “knock-knock” joke to a partner. tell a second one. the pattern becomes obvious. now tell your partner that you have one more, but your partner should start. this time the joke is in the confusion that results when the pattern is disrupted. in fact, most jokes involve the expectation of some sort of pattern which is invariably broken to form the joke. patterns not only help us make sense of the world, they allow us to form expectations and predict outcomes. thinking tools for innovators: part 5 – forming patterns mathematics - critical response recent research has shown that we can build innovative thinkers by reinforcing a set of thinking tools, including such skills as observing, abstracting, pattern recognition, modeling, and transforming (among others). as these skills can all be taught, it makes sense that we can help students become the creative thinkers that we will need in the twenty-first century. this lesson plan is the fifth in a series that is focused on using art to enrich instruction in these critical skills. the research on which this information is based can be found in many sources, perhaps best summarized in the book sparks of genius: the thirteen thinking tools of the world’s most creative people by robert and michele root-bernstein. thinking tools for innovators: part 6 – working with analogies language arts -

aesthetic response adapted and expanded from the 2011 philadelphia museum of art teaching kit, looking to write, writing to look. walking into a landscape language arts - aesthetic response we live in and experience landscapes every day—at school, at home, at work, on the commute, and through many other settings and experiences. often, we don’t pay much attention to these “everyday landscapes,” but just as often they hold special meaning for us. our personal landscapes may bring a sense of comfort, peace, or drama; and may even strike us an extraordinarily beautiful. artists can help us learn to explore and examine our surroundings. what can we learn by taking the time to look carefully at the world around us? what can we take away from observing artist’s depictions of landscapes they have experienced or observed? this lesson challenges students to look closely and examine different landscapes and imagine they are experiencing them firsthand. what do primary sources tell us about lifestyles? (u.s. history) social studies - historical & cultural contexts using primary sources encourages the researcher to form his/her own conclusions, rather than relying on the conclusions expressed by others in secondary sources. for more information, please contact education: school & teacher programs by phone at 215-684-7580, by fax at 215-236-4063, or by e-mail at . home school & teachers   arranging your school visit school tours & programs virtual field trips teacher programs teacher resources colleges wachovia education resource center community engagement   support education division   purchase admission online         © 2016 philadelphia museum of art search | sitemap | privacy & security | contacts © 2016 philadelphia museum of art search | sitemap | privacy & security | contacts 20

(age 5) i like being a member because you can see art for free. in honor of martin luther king jr. day, we asked our members how they think art can serve people. claudia librett, member since 2009, eloquently responded: illuminating truth, beauty, and love. often truth that we shy away from is embraced or at least received when it is expressed through art. beauty in nature and in art inspires and quiets our souls. only when we move with our hearts in making art does it express and embody love. no one can really thrive without art. practically from birth, my mom introduced me to great art in all forms and it has informed my career choices, enriched my life and fed my soul. i know for certain that it will do all that for my daughter as well. close member offers may 2016 $5 member guest admission to international pop now through may 15, 2016 membership required bring your friends and family for a last chance to see before it closes. $5 member guest offer valid may 3–15. cafeteria—complimentary house-made dessert now through may 31, 2016 membership required when ordering the chef’s table at granite hill. members save 10% at fleisher art memorial now through may 31, 2016 membership required save on class and workshop tuition when you use promo code pmamember at fleisher art memorial, through october 2016. close member voices in april we asked, “what is “pop” to you?” here are the responses: interesting questions. as an active museum visitor pop art is very low on my list. let me say this. there are plenty of art forms that i have no interest in. that's just my taste and does not disclaim that any of the forms that i am not interested in are "bad." pop has pieces that once explained are, to say the very least, interesting. they can be very thought provoking, very moving, and can deliver monumental messages. however, the bulk of it needs a full description of what the message is or what is going on. i was listening to a couple of pop fans at an exhibition carrying on about a piece like it was at least the replacement for the mona lisa. i asked what was the meaning of the piece. i received a dead stare. they liked it and that's ok. i would ask that the curators of the pop exhibits take the time to have placards available with an explanation or at least an educated paragraph about what pop fans think it is. there are not many shows at the pma that i have truly hated. in fact, that has never happened before, and i've been to nearly every one over the past 40+ years. but i hated international pop. it made me angry. i'm trying to analyze why, and i just don't know. basically it was ugly, ugly, ugly. i like all periods and genres of art, including modern, but this was just awful. the exhibition international pop was a revelation. totally convincing that the pop movement was not an american phenomenon with a small british division, but international in scope. mind-altering and terrifically entertaining with many rare masterpieces and only the occasional old chestnut that was cheerfully included. well curated show and great fun. well worth the drive from nyc to see this show. pop art is a satire on traditional fine art and how it becomes relatable to the viewers. it’s relate-able, view-able, and it is not abstract. there probably has been enough "pop." pop is the explosion of art generated by the freedom from social traditions taking place in the u.s. in the late 1950s and onward. images from popular culture invaded artspaces, trash became art, sculpture went soft, and repetition reigned to provide art access to the masses. pop appropriated images from modern culture, parading them as art, and begging the question once again, “what is art?” more importantly, pop energized the search for the new avant-guard that continues to this day. that's what pop means to me. in my mind, art is a many-faceted abstraction that can be interpreted very differently depending on the individual observer. what the original artist intended is irrelevant. does a composer expect the audience to dream up picturesque scenes in their minds as they listen to a performance? sometimes yes, sometimes no. sometimes the imagery is intentional. often times it is not. art is all things; ugly, political, social, anti-establishment, propaganda, dirty, sexual, offensive, cold, warm, beautiful, innocent, intelligent, and many, many other facets. beyond interpretation, art is something all cultures create and experience. like language, science, and math, art is something that connects all of humanity across borders, beliefs, and cultures. its importance cannot be overstated. pop art is important. often, it is linked to societal changes and upheavals. looking at older pop art can be like looking through a window to those times, and seeing the big craze of the time, what big events were occurring, or simply looking into the culture of the time, and seeing what people were experiencing in the day-to-day. the same could be said for popular music. as we progress, breaking down limitations and barriers in society, pop art also advances and progresses. it is not afraid of experimentation or being on the bleeding edge. that can enhance our perceptions, encourage abstract thinking, or simply inspire us in new ways. in that sense, pop art has a profound effect on the world. during members month we asked “why do you love being a member?” here are the responses: oh what a time to be alive! the lounge is great. thanks for creating it. the museum is terrific. it’s always interesting and there is something for people of all ages. it gives us grandparents a way to get a new generation into a love of the arts. revisiting my long-time friends—the magnificent and often changing collection of snuff bottles—in the asian art gallery. and now, the members’ lounge—a great, confortable space to get away from the crowds. such a special place. so good for the soul. because i like art. i just joined today 3/4/16 and i joined because these are fantastic museums! also, being a member will make me come up to philly more often from baltimore. having unlimited access to world class art. i love art! expressing texture, forms, color, etc. etc. etc! beauty in every form! pma is my home away from home. always refreshing and new. can’t get enough of what pma has to offer. thank you, pma. attending spotlight conversations. i love being a member because of the way i feel when i am here. i have been a member for 40 years. i am an art history grad. i share the museum with everyone. here today with 94 year-old mother and 82 year-old mother-in-law. a bit of beauty, history, and a great lunch are in order. we heart art! i’m a member as well as a volunteer at the museum. i love the programs here, the people, not to mention the great art collection! here, everyone can find something fun to do! i absolutely love this new members’ lounge, especially the “postcard station!” what an awesome idea. it’s great to be a member at the pma! all the staff are so nice and the museum is so kind friendly! we especially love art after 5. by being members we feel more inclined to come because we feel a part of the museum. we’re making art part of our lives. because i can relax in the lounge with tea or coffee while i decide which members-only collection tour to take next and discover neat art catalogues, like “landscape of slavery” edited by mack and hoffius, tucked among miro works on the wall. i like art and it is an art museum and i like learning about art. i like seeing famous art, and i like doing art. i heart that you are open late on wed + fridays 2x the opportunities to explore=happiness. thank you art museum membership is one of my best annual investments. art and beauty, all year long! now that i am a member, i am discovering parts of the museum that i have never seen. i can come for short—or long—visits whenever i want! membership makes us part of the legacy of art. supporting pma is a way of contributing to the community in a positive way! the museum is cool and comfortable (and totally tubular) the philadelphia museum of art definitely appreciates its members more than other similar institutions i’ve been a member at. love is in the air. life is so civilized when you are a member. i like the knights (age 4). art splash + armor (age 12). the family hands-on events. i live in the neighborhood and there is always something going on at the museum if i have no plans. plus, it expands my mind! i like how the museum is working hard to broaden its appeal in creative ways in the physical space, new tour ideas, programs, etc. keep on! oh, how do i love thee—let me count the ways!

giving plan your legacy planned giving calculator fiske kimball society plan your legacylegacy gifts strengthen the museum’s endowment, provide much-needed annual income, and support its extraordinary collection and acclaimed educational programs. by including the museum in your long-term plans, you can achieve the goals that are important to you—to benefit yourself, your family, and an institution that you value and believe in. in addition to a bequest in your will, there are other ways you may make a legacy gift. you can name the museum as a beneficiary of your retirement plan, or life insurance policy. if you are looking for a way to supplement your income, you can establish a charitable gift annuity, or a charitable remainder trust, which are gifts that will support the museum and pay you, and/or other designated beneficiaries, income for life. the museum’s easy-to use planned giving calculator can provide you with an illustration of the income and tax benefits to which you may be entitled if you make a planned gift to the museum. all those who have established a planned gift are recognized with membership in the fiske kimball society. bequests one of the easiest and most popular ways to make a planned gift is to include the philadelphia museum of art in your will or revocable living trust. “works that together teach about history and about beauty”— dr. alvin o. bellak making a bequest is a way of demonstrating your commitment to the future of the museum that doesn't affect your current asset balance or cash flow. if you already have a will, it is not necessary to rewrite it to make a bequest to the museum. you can simply instruct your attorney to prepare a codicil—an amendment—to your current will or living trust. if you choose to make an outright bequest, the provision in your will or codicil can be very straightforward. for example: "i hereby give, devise and bequeath to the philadelphia museum of art, a nonprofit corporation organized and operating under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania, the sum of $_______(or ___ percent of the rest, residue and remainder of my estate) to be used for the general purposes of the museum (or for a particular program of your choosing)." if you have already remembered the museum in your will and would like to become a member of the fiske kimball society, please contact the office of planned giving by phone at 215-684-7351, or by e-mail at supporting the future of the museum through your will offers: simplicity – add a codicil to an already existing will. flexibility – change your gift if you wish to do so. control – retain control of your assets should you need them in the future. if you wish to protect a loved one as well as make a contribution to the museum, charitable trusts of various types may be established in your will that will first provide financial benefits for a spouse, other family member or a friend. then, at the termination of the trust, the remainder will pass to the museum. charitable gift annuities a charitable gift annuity provides you with regular fixed payments annually (an annuity) for life in exchange for transferring assets to the museum. “for us, the absence of art would be dreadful. we wanted to do something significant ... ”— the rochbergs a charitable gift annuity is a simple contract between you and the philadelphia museum of art. in exchange for your gift of cash or securities, the museum will provide you with a lifelong annuity, a portion of which is tax-free. the rate that determines your annuity payment currently ranges from 4.4 to 9.0 percent, depending upon your age (and/or the age of your other designated beneficiary). a deferred charitable gift annuity offers you the opportunity to claim a charitable deduction in the year of your gift, but receive payments at later time designated by you. in addition to a lifelong annuity and an immediate tax deduction, other benefits of funding a charitable annuity include: the fixed annuity payment is sheltered from stock market volatility. your contributed assets are removed from your taxable estate. you can become a member of the fiske kimball society. gift annuity rates - single life age 60 65 70 75 80 85 90+ rates (%) 4.4 4.7 5.1 5.8 6.8 7.8 9.0 rates are effective as of january 1, 2012 and are recommended by the american council on gift annuities. use our planned giving calculator. the calculator is designed to provide you with an illustration of the income and tax benefits to which you may be entitled if you establish a charitable gift annuity. when using the calculator, please select charitable gift annuity when asked for "gift type." charitable remainder trusts a charitable remainder trust is an agreement between you and a trustee that can provide fixed or variable income to meet your specific financial needs, at the termination of which the remaining assets are passed to the museum. “you don’t need vast wealth to make a difference—a lot of people can be part of something important.”— the sabatinos a charitable remainder trust provides you and/or another beneficiary(s) with fixed or variable income for life or for a specific period of time and thereafter distributes the remaining assets in the trust to the museum. a charitable remainder trust is individually tailored to meet your needs: you can select the beneficiaries, the trustees (including the museum), your income rate, and type of trust. annual distributions from a charitable remainder unitrust are variable and are based on the value of the principal, re-valued annually. a charitable remainder annuity trust pays a fixed annual distribution based upon the value of the principal at the time of the gift. since each trust is individually tailored, there is more flexibility in the type of property that can be donated, including real estate or tax-free municipal bonds. use our planned giving calculator. the calculator is designed to provide you with an illustration of the income and tax benefits to which you may be entitled if you establish a charitable remainder trust. select either charitable remainder annuity trust or charitable remainder unitrust (as defined on the calculator page) when indicating "gift type." for proper results, please indicate under "term type" either the birth date(s) of the income beneficiary(ies) or the number of years (up to 20) you wish the trust to last. charitable lead trusts a charitable lead trust enables you to preserve a portion of your estate and pass assets tax-free to your heirs. this arrangement provides income to the museum for a period of years, after which the trust property typically passes to the donor's heirs. income-producing assets that are expected to gain in value such as stock or real estate are irrevocably transferred to a trust. the museum receives income from the trust for a specified number of years, after which the property in the trust is transferred to the heirs without the imposition of any additional taxes. an immediate charitable deduction on your gift tax return is available for the present value of the total income stream the museum will receive during the trust term. this gift can reduce or effectively eliminate the gift and/or estate tax that would normally be payable on the transfer of these assets to your heirs. use our planned giving calculator. the calculator is designed to provide you with an illustration of the income and tax benefits to which you may be entitled if you establish a charitable lead trust to benefit the museum. gifts of plans and policies iras and qualified retirement plans like 401(k)s are some of the best assets to leave to charity. you may also designate the museum as owner and/or beneficiary of a life insurance policy. gifts of tax-deferred retirement planspeople are often surprised to learn that the assets they thought would pass to their heirs are among the most heavily taxed in their estates. the combination of federal income, estate and excise taxes can seriously erode the value of retirement savings when received by an heir. designating the philadelphia museum of art as a beneficiary or contingent beneficiary of all or a specified percentage of your 401k or other retirement plan assets can save your estate both income and federal estate taxes. the process is easy. you can leave a percentage of your retirement assets or a specific dollar amount. just notify your plan’s administrator of your intention and complete a “change of beneficiary” form. gifts of life insurance policiesyou may also designate the museum as owner and/or the beneficiary of a life insurance policy—either a new policy or an existing one that you and your family no longer need. simply contact your retirement plan administrator or insurance agent and ask for the appropriate forms. gifts of real estate the gift of your primary residence or a vacation home is a unique and meaningful way to support the museum. you may leave your home to the museum as a bequest in your will, or you may consider donating it now, but retaining the right to live in your home for your lifetime. real estate is also an attractive asset when used to establish a charitable remainder or charitable lead trust.   the purpose of this web page is to provide information of a general character only. the philadelphia museum of art is not engaged in

to me, pop art and music have always lived together. especially rock music. i have no memory of one without the other. i was just a kid when beatlemania exploded and i remember andy warhol’s campbell’s soup can getting a lot of attention at the same time. it was all mixed together. dylan going electric, roy lichtenstein creating comic strip panels, whatever. it didn’t seem to matter. the barriers between commercial product and fine art seemed to be disappearing and not everyone was happy about it. it was a very exciting time. very anti-authoritarian. other fields were affected too (photography, film) but american music and art was what i was paying attention to back then. later on i discovered how international this period of change was. read more of our talk with ben vaughn >> organizerinternational pop is organized by the walker art center. sponsorthis exhibition is supported by an indemnity from the federal council on the arts and the humanities. major support for the exhibition is provided by the henry luce foundation, the prospect creek foundation, the terra foundation for american art, the andy warhol foundation for the visual arts, and the margaret and angus wurtele family foundation. additional support is generously provided by judy dayton, lyn de logi, marge and irv weiser, and audrey and zygi wilf. in philadelphia, the exhibition is supported by the estate of phyllis t. ballinger, the women’s committee of the philadelphia museum of art, the annenberg foundation fund for major exhibitions, the laura and william c. buck endowment for exhibitions, the roy lichtenstein foundation, and the japan-united states friendship commission. additional generous donors include john alchin and hal marryatt, mitchell l. and hilarie l. morgan, isabel and agustín coppel, jaimie and david field, marsha and jeffrey perelman, and lyn m. ross. corporate support generously provided by rbc wealth management. the museum gratefully recognizes exhibition media partner time out. curatorerica f. battle, the john alchin and hal marryatt associate curator of contemporary art locationdorrance special exhibition galleries, first floor home on view   current exhibitions upcoming exhibitions past exhibitions in the galleries sculpture garden   group tour info school tour info   purchase admission online           © 2016 philadelphia museum of art search | sitemap | privacy & security | contacts © 2016 philadelphia museum of art search | sitemap | privacy & security | contacts 5 0

are the amount and kind of the material used appropriate to the intended use? these questions are discussed, along with examples of applications, in the code of best practices in fair use for academic and research libraries. this is a very useful tool for making a fair use determination in typical teaching, learning, and research situations. codes of best practice in fair use have been developed for many other applications by scholars, artists, teachers, librarians, and other users and creators of content. examples include online video, opencourseware, and poetry. see the dartmouth library copyright information web pages for more details and assistance. copyright guidelines for the use of materials on course web sites and course reserves guidance to instructors, librarians, and support staff concerning the circumstances under which they may, consistent with the copyright law, place course materials on electronic reserves or on course web sites.        19 8019 801a 199  74 c contact us2f 24 top of page | 43copyright © 872016 trustees of dartmouth college 417f1d7ff 115 last updated: 4/9/150
